CHAPTER FOURTEEN 


EDUCATING THE PARENT 

T his book, as we have indicated on several oc- 
casions, is addressed to parents and teachers, 
both of whom may profit equally from the new psy- 
chological insight into the mental life of the child. 
In the last analysis, it does not matter much 
whether the education and development of the child 
take place for the most part under the auspices of 
the parent or under the auspices of the teacher, 
provided the child gets the proper education. We 
are referring of course to extra-curricular educa- 
tion — ^not the teaching of subjects of study, but the 
development of personality, which is the most im- 
portant part of education. Now, although both the 
parent and the teacher can each contribute his share 
in this educational work— the parent correcting the 
deficiencies of the school, and the teacher correcting 
the deficiencies of the home — ^it is nonetheless true 
that in our large cities, and under modern social 
and economic conditions, the greater part of the 


 
responsibility falls on the teacher. Taken en masse 
parents are not as permeable to new ideas as are 
onr teachers, who have a professional interest in the 
education of children. The hope of Individual Psy- 
chology in preparing the children of to-morrow 
rests primarily on converting the schools and the 
teachers — although the co-operation of parents is 
of course never rejected. 

NTow in the course of the educational work of the 
teacher, there comes up inevitably a conflict Vv^ith 
the parent. The conflict is all the more inevitable in 
that the teacher’s correctional work presupposes in 
some measure the failure of the parent. It is in a 
sense an accusation against the parent, and the par- 
ent very often feels it as such. How shall the 
teacher handle the parent in this type of situation? 

The following remarks are addressed to this 
problem. They are written, of course, from the 
point of view of the teacher, who needs to handle 
the parent as a psychological problem. If these re- 
marks are read by parents, they need give no of- 
fense, since they apply only to the unintelligent 
parent who forms the mass phenomenon that the 
teacher has to deal with. 

Many a teacher has remarked that it is often 
more difficult to approach the parents of a problem 


 
cliild than it is to approach the child himself » This 
fact indicates that it is always necessary for the 
teacher to proceed with a certain amount of tact. 
The teacher must always act on the assumption that 
the parents are not responsible for all the bad qual- 
ities the child shows. The parents are after all not 
skillful pedagogues and they usually have only 
tradition to guide them. When they are summoned 
to school on account of their children they come 
feeling like accused criminals. Such a mood, he- 
spealdng as it does some inward consciousness of 
guilt, demands the most tactful treatment at the 
hands of the teacher. It is therefore most desirable 
that the teacher should try in such cases to change 
the parents’ mood to a friendly and a freer one, to 
place himself at the disposal of the parents as an 
assistant and to rely on their good intentions. 

The parents should never be reproached even 
when there are just grounds. We can achieve much 
more when we succeed in establishing a sort of pact, 
when we persuade the parents to change their atti- 
tude and work with us according to our methods. 
It is of no avail to point out to them the faults in 
their past treatment. WTiat we must do is to try to 
make them adopt a new procedure. To tell them 
that they have done this or that wrongly, only of- 


 
fends them and makes them unwilling to co-operate. 
As a rule the deterioration of a child does not take 
place out of a clear sky; there is always a past his- 
tory. The parents come to school in the belief that 
they have overlooked something. They should never 
be permitted to feel that we think so; they should 
never be spoken to categorically or dogmatically. 
Suggestions to parents should never be made in an 
authoritative manner. The sentences should always 
have a “perhaps,” “probably,” “possibly,” “you 
might try it this way.” Even if we know exactly 
where the mistake is and how it is to be corrected, 
w'e should never point it out to the parents bluntly 
as if we want to force them. It goes without saying 
that so much tact is not always to be found in every 
teacher, neither is it acquired suddenly. It is inter- 
esting to see the same thoughts expressed in the au- 
tobiography of Benjamin Franklin. He writes 
there: 

“A Quaker friend having kindly informed me 
that I was generally thought, proud, that my pride 
showed itself frequently in conversation, that I was 
not content with being in the right when discussing 
any point, but was overbearing and rather insolent, 
of which he convinced me by mentioning several in- 
stances, I determined endeavoring to cure myself, 

: M2 


 
if I collide of this vice or folly among the rest^ and 
I added Humility to my 1st, giving an extensive 
meaning to the word. 

“I cannot boast of much success in acquiring* the 
reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal mtli re- 
gard to the appearance of it. I made it a rule to 
forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of 
others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even 
forbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our 
Junto, the use of every word or expression in the 
language that imported a fixed opinion, such as cer- 
tainly, undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted, instead of 
them, I conceive, I apprehend or I imagine a thing 
to be so or so, or so it appears to me at present. 
When another asserted something that I thought 
an error, I denied myself the pleasure of contra- 
dicting him abruptly and of showing immediately 
some absurdity in his proposition; and in answer- 
ing I began by observing that in certain cases or 
circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the 
present case there appeared or seemed to me some 
difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this 
change in my manner ; the conversations I engaged 
in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in 
which I proposed my opinions procured them a 
readier reception and less contradiction; I had less 



 
mortification when I was found to be in the wrongs 
and I more easily prevailed with others to give up 
their mistakes and join with me when I happened 
to he in the right. 

“And this mode, which I at first put on with 
some violence to natural inclination, became at 
length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps 
for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a 
dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit 
(after my character of integrity) I think it prin- 
cipally owing that I had early so much weight with 
my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institu- 
tions, or alterations in the old, and so much in- 
fluence in public councils when I became a member ; 
for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject 
to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly 
correct in language, and yet I generally carried my 
points, 

“In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our nat- 
ural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise 
it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify 
it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will 
every now and then peep out and show itself; you 
will see it, perhaps, often in this history; for, even 
if I could conceive that I had completely overcome 
it, I should probably he proud of my humility.”’ 



 

It is true that these words do not fit every situa- 
tion ill life. This can neither be expected nor de- 
manded. Franklin®s attitude, nevertheless, shows us 
how unsuitable and unsuccessful aggressive opposi- 
tion may be. There is no basic law in life which 
holds good for every situation. Every rule goes 
only so far and then all of a sudden becomes un- 
workable. There are certainly situations in which a 
strong word is the only right one. However, when 
we consider the situation between the teacher on the 
one hand, and, on the other, the worried parents 
who have already experienced humiliation and are 
prepared for further humiliation on account of 
their child, and when we also consider that without 
the parents’ co-operation we can do nothing, it is 
obvious that Franklin’s method is the only logical 
one to adopt in order to help the child. 

Under such circumstances, where it is of no im- 
portance to be able to prove that one is right, or to 
show one’s superiority, hut where it is necessary to 
prepare the road which we must tread to help the 
child, there are naturally many difiicuities. Many 
parents do not want to hear any suggestions. They 
are astonished or indignant, impatient and inimical 
because the teacher has placed them and their child 
in such an unpleasant situation. Such parents have 


 
iisually been trying for some time to dose tlieir eyes 
to the faults of their child, to blind themselves to 
reality. Suddenly their eyes are forcibly opened for 
them. The whole matter is most disagreeable, and 
it is understandable that a teacher who approaches 
such parents brusquely or too energetical!}’ loses all 
possibility of winning the parents over to his side. 
Many parents go even further. They meet the 
teacher with a verbal tide of indignation and make 
themselves imapproachable. In such cases it is het“ 
ter to show the parents that the teacher is depend- 
ent upon their assistance ; it is better to quiet them 
and bring them to the point of speaking in a 
friendly manner with the teacher. It must not be 
forgotten that parents are often so entangled in the 
meshes of traditional, antiquated methods that they 
cannot free themselves quickly. 

For example, when a father has discouraged his 
child badly by stern words and a sour facial expres- 
sion, it is naturally hard for him, after ten years, 
suddenly to assume a friendly expression and to 
speak kindly to the child. It might be mentioned 
here that when a father suddenly changes his whole 
attitude towards his child, the latter will not believe 
at first that the change is a sincere one. He will re- 
gard it as a trick and will have to gain confidence 



 
slowly in liis parent’s changed demeanor. Highly 
intellectual persons are no exceptions. There is a 
case of a high school principal who had driven liis 
son almost to the point of breakdown by constant 
criticising and nagging. The principal realized this 
in a conversation lie had with us ; then he went home 
and delivered a scathing sermon to his son. He had 
lost his temper again because his son had been lazy. 
Every time his son did something which did not 
please liini his father lost his temper and spoke 
cruelly. When this is possible with a man who con- 
siders himself a pedagogue we can imagine how it 
is with those parents who have grown up with the 
dogmatic idea that every child must be punished for 
his mistakes by a whipping. Every device Imown to 
diplomatic art, every tactful phrase which occurs 
to the teacher must be employed in conversations 
with parents. 

It must not be forgotten that the custom of edu- 
cating children to the accompaniment of blows is 
widely spread in the poorer classes. And so it hap- 
pens that children from these ranks, going home 
after a corrective conference with their teacher, find 
a continuation in the form of a whipping awaiting 
them from their parents. We are in the sad state of 
having to remember that our pedagogical efforts 


THE EDUCATION OP CHILDREN 
are all too frequently brouglit to naught by the un- 
wise parental treatment at home» In such cases^ 
children are often punished twice for the same mis- 
take, when we are of the opinion that once is 
eiio'ogh. 

We know the terrible results which sometimes 
follow such double punishment. Take the case of a 
child who must bring home a bad report card. 
Afraid of a whipping, he does not show it to his 
parents, and then afraid of punishment at school, 
he plays truant; or else he forges his parent’s sig- 
nature to the card. We must not overlook these 
facts, nor must we regard them liglitly ; we must al- 
ways regard the child in his relation to the various 
elements in his environment. We must ask our- 
selves : What happens now when I go ahead. How 
will it affect this child. Wliat certainty have I that 
it will have a benehcial effect on him? Has the child 
gotten to the point where he can bear a burden, and 
wall he be able to learn something constructive 
from it? 

We know how differently children and adults re- 
act to difficulties. We must be most careful in re- 
education and must be reasonably certain of results 
before we attempt to remould the life pattern of a 
child. He who has always proceeded with delibera- 



 
tioii and objective judgment in the education and 
re-education of children will be able to predict with 
greater certainty the results of his efforts. Practice 
and courage are essential in pedagogical work, as 
is also the unshakable belief that no matter what 
the circumstances may be, there is always a way to 
prevent a child from having a breakdown. First of 
all, there is the old and well-recognized rule that it 
is never too early to start. He who is accustomed to 
regard a human being as a unity and to regard 
symptoms as part of a unity, will be able to under- 
stand and to help a child very much better than he 
who is accustomed to seize upon a symptom and 
treat it according to some rigid scheme — as in the 
case, say, of a teacher who, when a child has failed 
to do his homework, immediately writes a note 
about it to the child’s parents. 

We are entering a period which is bringing with 
it new ideas, new methods and new understanding 
in . Science is doing away 
with old worn out ci|stoms and traditions. The 
knowledge we are gaining places more responsibil- 
ity on the teacher, but as a compensation it gives 
him far more understanding of the problems of 
childhood and with it far greater ability to help the 
children who pass through his hands. The impor- 


 
taut tiling to remember is that a single conduct 
manifestation has no meaning when detached from 
the personality as a whole, and that we can under- 
stand it only when we study it in coiinection 
the rest of the human being.

plaint? What sort of situation (psychic or other- 
wise) did the child j&nd himself in when his failings 
were first noticed? 

The following are important: change of en- 
vironment, beginning of school life, births in 
the family, younger or older brothers and sis- 
ters, failures in school, changes of teachers or 
school, new friendships, illnesses of the child, 
divorce, new marriage, death of the parents. 

age in regard to mental or physical weakness, tim- 
idity, carelessness, reserve, clumsiness, envy, jeal- 
ousy, dependence on others when eating, dressing, 
washing or going to bed? Was the child afraid of 



 
being alone or of darkness? Does lie understand his 
sexual role? Any primary, secondary or tertiary 
characteristics of gender? How does lie regard the 
opposite sex? How far has he been enlightened on 
his sexual role? Is he a stepchild? Illegitimate? A 
foster child? Orphan? How did his foster parents 
treat him? Is there still a contact? Did he learn to 
speak and walk at the right time? Without diffi- 
culty? Was the teething normal? Noticeable diffi- 
culties in learning to read, draw, sing, swim? Is he 
particularly attached to either his father, his 
mother, his grandparents or his nurse ? 

It is necessary to determine whether he is hos- 
tile towards his environment, and to look for 
the origin of his feeling of inferiority ; whether 
there is a tendency to avoid difficulties and 
whether he shows traits of egoism and sensi- 
tiveness. 

whom does he fear most? Does he cry out at night? 
Does he suffer from enuresis? Is he domineering 
towards weaker children or towards stronger chil- 
dren as well? Did he show a strong desire to sleep 
in his parents’ bed? Was he clumsy? Did he suffer 
from rickets? What about his intelligence? "Was lie 
much teased and derided? Does he show vanity in 
regard to his hair, clothes, shoes, etc.? Does he in- 


 

diilge in nail-biting or nose-picking? Is he greedy 
when eating? 

It would be illuminating to know if he strives 
more or less courageously after priority; fur- 
ther, if obstinacy prevents him fro^m pursuing 
his impulse to action, 

erance towards persons and animals, or does he 
molest and torment them? Is he fond of collecting or 
hoarding? What about avarice and covetousness? 
Does lie lead others? Is he inclined to isolate him- 
self? 

These questions are in connection with the 
child’s ability to “get in touch” and the degree 
of his discouragement. 

is the present position of the child? How does he con- 
duct himself in school? Does he like school? Is he 
punctual? Is he excited before going to school? Is 
he ill a hurry? Does he lose his books, satchel, 
exercise-books? Is he excited about exercises and 
before examinations ? Does he forget to do his school 
work, or does he refuse to do it? Does he waste his 
time? Is he lazy? Is there a lack of concentration? 
Does he disturb the class? How does he regard the 
teacher ? Is he critical, arrogant, indiiferent towards 



 
the teacher ? Does he ask others to help him with his 
lessons or does he wait until he is invited ? Is lie am- 
bitious in regard to gymnastics and sport? Does he 
consider himself comparatively untalented or en- 
tirely so? Is he a great reader? What sort of litera- 
ture does he prefer? 

Questions that help us to understand how far 
the child is properly prepared for school life, 
the result of the “going to school experiment,” 
and his attitude towards difficulties. 

stances, illness in the family, alcoholism, criminal 
tendencies, neurosis, debility, lues, epilepsy, the 
standard of living. Any deaths in the family, and 
how old was the child when they occurred? Is he an 
orphan? Who is the dominating spirit of the family? 
Is the home education strict, with much grumbling 
and fault-finding, or is it indulgent? Are the home 
influences such as to make the child afraid of life? 
What about supervision? 

From his position and attitude in the family 
circle we may judge of the impressions the 
child receives. 

place in the family constellation? Is he the eldest, 
the youngest, the only child, the only boy, the only 



 ' 
girl? Is there rivalry, much crying, malicious laugh- 
ter, a strong tendency to depreciate others? 

The above is important for the study of char- 
acter, and throws light on the child’s attitude 
towards others. 

of a profession ? What does he think about man-iage ? 
What profession do the other members of the family 
follow? What about the married life of the parents? 

It may be concluded from this whether the 
child has courage and confidence for the future. 

in history and fiction? Is he fond of spoiling other 
children’s games? Is he imaginative? Is he a cool- 
headed thinker? Does he indulge in daydreaming? 

These questions are in reference to a possible 
tendency to play the hero in life. A contrast in 
the child’s behavior may be regarded as a sign 
of discouragement. 

odical dreams about flying, falling, powerlessness, 
late arrival at railway station, anxiety dreams? 

In this connection we often find a tendency to 
isolation, warnings to be careful, ambitious 
traits and a preference for particular persons, 
country life, etc. 




 

Does he consider himself neglected? Does lie re- 
spoiid readily to attention and praise ? Has lie super- 
stitious ideas? Does he avoid difficulties ? Does he try 
his hand at various things only to give them up 
again? Is he uncertain about his future? Does he be- 
lieve in the injurious effects of heredity ? Was he sys- 
tematically discouraged by those around him? Is his 
outlook on life pessimistic? 

Answers to these questions will help us to 
prove that the child has lost confidence in him- 
self and that he is now on the wrong road. 

grimacing, pretending to be stupid, childish, comi- 
cal ? 

In such cases slight courage is manifested for 
the purpose of attracting attention, 

footed? Knock-kneed or bow-legged? Stunted? Ab- 
normally stout or tall? Badly proportioned? Has he 
constitutional abnormalities of eye or ear? Is he 
mentally backward? Left-handed? Does he snore at 
night? Is he remarkably handsome? 

These are disadvantages which the child as a 
rule overestimates, and by which he may be 
permanently discouraged. A faulty develop- 


 


meiit is often seen too in the case of very pretty 
children who become obsessed with the idea 
that they should get everything they want 
without exerting themselves. Such children 
miss numerous opportunities of preparing 
themselves for life. 

of talent” for school, for work, for life? Does he liar™ 
bor suicidal thoughts? Is there any connection in 
point of time between his failures and troubles ? Does 
he overrate apparent success ? Is he servile, bigoted, 
rebellious ? 

Here we have manifestations of extreme dis- 
couragement, mostly apparent after vain ef- 
forts on the part of the child to get rid of his 
troubles. His failures are due partly to the in- 
effectuality of his efforts and partly to a lack 
of understanding of persons in touch with him. 
But his inclinations must be satisfied somehow, 
somewhere; so he seeks some other, easier 
scene of action. “Nebenkriegsschauplatz.” 


ful. 

Such “positive performances” give us impor- 
tant hints, for it is possible that the interests, 
inclinations and preparations of the child point 
in a different direction from that in which he 
has hitherto gone. 

From answers to the above questions (which 


 
should never be put in regular sequence or roiitine- 
like, but constructively and by way of conversation) 
a correct notion of the individuality is formed. It 
will be seen that though the failures are not justified, 
they are conceivable and can be understood. The er- 
rors disclosed should always be explained in a pa- 
tient and friendly way, without any threats. 


APPENDIX II 


FIVE CASE HISTORIES WITH 
COMMENTARIES 

I 

A boy, iifteen years old, is the only child of par- 
ents who have worked hard to achieve a modestly 
comfortable existence. They have been careful to 
see that the boy had everything necessary for physi- 
cal health. In his early years the boy was happy and 
healthy. His mother is a good woman, but she cries 
too easily. Her report of her son is made with much 
effort and many interruptions. We do not know the 
father, but the mother describes him as an honest, 
energetic man who loves his family and who has 
much confidence in himself. When the boy was very 
young and was disobedient, the father would re- 
mark, *Tt would be a fine state of affairs if I couldn’t 
break his will.” His idea of “breaking” was setting 
the boy a good example, not bothering to teach him 
much, but whipping him whenever he did something 


 
wrong. In the boy’s early childhood, his rebellious” 
ness was expressed by Iiis wanting to play master of 
the bouse, a desire frequently found in the spoiled, 
only child. He showed early a striking inclination to 
disobedience and developed the habit of refusing 
to obey so long as he did not feel the hand of his 
father. 

When we stop here and ask what salient charac- 
ter trait will surely develop in this child, we must 
answer, “Lying.” He will lie to escape his father’s 
heavy hand. It is indeed the chief complaint with 
which the mother comes to us. To-day the child is 
fifteen years old and the parents never know whether 
he is lying or telling the truth. When we probe a lit- 
tle more deeply, we hear the following; The child 
was for a time in a parocliial school, w4ere his 
teachers also complained that he was disobedient and 
disturbed the class. For example, he would shout the 
answer to a question before he was asked, or he would 
ask a question in order to interrupt, or talk loudly to 
his classmates during class.. He would write his 
homework in a most illegible hand — ^he w>-as, more- 
over, left-handed. His conduct finally got beyond all 
bounds and his lying was noticeable as soon as lie 
feared punishment from his father. His parents at 


 
first decided to leave turn in the school, hot be- 
fore long they had to take him out because his 
teacher concluded that nothing could be done with 

him. 

The boy looked like a lively lad whose intelligence 
was recognized by all the teachers. He finished pub- 
lic school and had to take the entrance examinations 
for high school. His mother awaited him after the 
examination and he told her that he had passed the 
test. Every one was very happy and they all went to 
the country for the summer. The boy frequently 
spoke of high school. Then the high school reopened. 
The boy packed his schoolbag, went to school and 
came home each day for lunch. One day, however, 
the mother walked with him part of the way and as 
they crossed the street together, she heard a man 
say, “There’s the boy who showed me the way to the 
station this morning.” His mother asked him what 
the man meant, and whether he hadn’t been to school 
that morning. The lad answered that school had 
ended at ten o’clock, and he had walked with the man 
to the railroad station. His mother was not satisfied 
with the explanation and later spoke to the father 
about the matter. The father decided to accompany 
his son to school the following day. The next day, on 



 
tlie way to school, the father learned, in answer to his 
insistent questioning, that the boy had failed in his 
entrance examinations, that he had never been to 
high school, and that he had loafed around the 
streets all these days. 

His parents engaged a tutor and the boy was 
eventually able to pass the examinations, but his con- 
duct did not improve. He still disturbed the class- 
room procedure, and one day he began to steal. He 
stole some money from his mother, lied violently 
about it, and only confessed when threatened with 
the police. And now we have before us a case of sad 
neglect. The father, whose pride was such that he 
thought he could bend this twig, now gives his son 
up as hopeless. The boy is punished by being left 
alone with no one speaking to him or paying any at- 
tention to him. His parents also claim that they no 
longer beat him. 

In answer to the question “Since when has there 
been cause for complaint?” the mother replies, 
“Since his birth.” When we receive such an answer, 
we assume that the mother wants to imply that the 
boy’s bad conduct is inborn, since his parents have 
tried everything to straighten him out, and have been 
unsuccessful. 




 
Asa baby, the boy was extremely restless, he cried 
day and night. All the doctors, however, declared 
that he was quite normal and healthy. 

This is not as simple as it sounds. There is nothing 
remarkable in the fact that nursing infants cry. 
There are many reasons for it, especially in the case 
of an only child where the mother has had no previ- 
ous experience. Such children usually cry when they 
are wet, a condition of which the mother is not al- 
ways aware. What did his mother do when he cried? 
She took the baby in her arms, rocked it and gave it 
something to drink. What she should have done was 
to find out the real cause of the crying, make the 
child comfortable and then pay no more attention to 
him. The child would have stopped crying and would 
not now have this black spot in his past. 

His mother says that he learned to talk and walk 
at a normal age without difficulty, and that his teeth 
developed normally. He had a habit of destroying 
his playthings soon after they were given to him. 
Such manifestations are often found without neces- 
sarily indicating a bad character. Worthy of note is 
the sentence, “It was impossible to make him occupy 
himself for any length of time with any one thing,” 
We must ask here how should a mother train a child 


 


to play alone. There is only one way to do it. The 
child must be permitted to occupy himself without 
constant interruption by adults. We suspect that 
this mother did not do this and several remarks indi- 
cate it; for example, that the boy always gave her 
a lot to do, that be always clung to her, etc. Here are 
the child’s first attempts to induce his mother to 
pamper him, the oldest inscriptions on the scroll of 
his soul. 

The child was never left alone. 

The mother obviously says that in self-defense. 

He was never alone and to this day he does not 
like to he left alone even for an hour. Evenings he is 
never alone^ and he has also never been left alone 
during the night hours. 

Here is proof of how closely the child is tied to his 
mother and how he has always been able to lean on 
her. 

He was never afraid^ and does not know fear to- 
day. 

That is a statement which challenges psychologi- 
cal common sense since it does not agree with our 
findings. A closer examination of the facts gives us 
the explanation. The boy has never been left alone ; 




 
there was, therefore, no necessity for him to be 
afraid, since with such children fear is a means to 
compel others to remain with them. Consequently 
there was no place for fear, an emotion which he 
would have manifested as soon as he was left alone. 
Now comes another seeming contradiction. 

He has a great fear of Ms father's cane. So he did 
have fear? MHien the whipping was over^ however, 
he forgot it quickly and was lively again, even 
though he was sometimes spanked severely. 

Here we see the unfortunate contrast: the mother 
yielding; the father stern, wanting to correct the 
mother’s softness. And the child is driven more and 
more in the direction of his mother through his 
father’s harshness. That is to say, he turns toward 
the person who pampers him, toward the person 
from whom he can get everything easily and cheaply. 

In the parochial school, at the age of six, he came 
under the supervision of the priests, and at that time 
the complaints began about his liveliness, restlessness 
and inattentiveness. Complaints about his conduct 
were much more frequent than about his school- 
work. What was most noticeable was his restless- 
ness. When a child wants to attract attention what 
better method can he choose than to be restless ? This 


 
child wants to be noticed. He has formed the habit of 
attracting his mother’s attention, and now, in a 
larger circle, he wants the attention of the new mem- 
hers of the larger group at school. When the teacher 
does not understand the child’s purpose, he attempts 
to correct the child’s conduct by singling him out for 
scolding or for reprimanding, and the boy is then 
where he wants to be. He has to pay a big price for 
the attention he secures, but he is used to that. He 
received enough beatings at home and remained un- 
changed. Are we to assume that he is to be dislodged 
from his old ways by the milder forms of punishment 
permitted the school? That is most improbable. 
When he condescended to go to school, he wanted to 
be the center of attention as a compensation. 

The parents tried to improve his behavior by 
pointing out to him that it was necessary for the good 
of the class that every one keep quiet. When one 
hears such antiquated admonitions, one is somewhat 
dubious about the common sense of the parents. The 
boy knows as well as the grown-ups what is right and 
what is wrong. He is, however, busy with quite an- 
other problem. He wants to he noticed and he cannot 
gain any attention in school by being quiet ; neither 
is it easy to gain attention by hard work. We see no 
riddle in his conduct as soon as we are aware of the 



 
task he has set himself. Obviously, when the father 
comes along with his cane, the boy will be quiet for a 
while. But the mother says that as soon as the father 
goes away, the boy starts all over again. He regards 
the whippings and punishments only as interrup- 
tions which disturb his progress for short periods, 
but do not by any means achieve the effect of per- 
manent change. 

But his temperament always broke through the 
restraint. 

Children who want to attract attention must ob- 
viously do it by temperament. We see that what one 
usually calls temperament is nothing more than a 
convenient rhythm in which one fulfills tasks and is 
a form of movement determined by the goal. For 
example, if one wants to lie quietly on the sofa one 
will not need to develop such temperament. This 
temperament becomes a suspicious indication of 
what a person has in mind — in our case, to make 
himself conspicuous. 

Me formed the habit of taking all sorts of things 
from the house to school, exchanging them for 
money and entertaining his comrades with the pro- 
ceeds. When his parents discovered this he was 


 
searched each day before leaving for scJiooL He 
finally abandoned the practice and confined, himself 
to playing jokes and making interruptions,- This 
change was brought about only by severe punish- 
ment from his father. 

We can understand his playing jokes; that be- 
longs to his desire to make others notice him, to force 
his teacher to penalize him and to make himself su- 
perior to the school regulations. 

His attempts to ci'cate disturbances gradually 
diminished^ hut returned periodically in full force 
and resulted in his being expelled from one school. 

Here is the confirmation of what we said before. 
This boy, w^ho struggles to obtain recognition from 
others, naturally meets obstacles and becomes aware 
of them. In addition, when we consider that he was 
left-handed, we have more insight into his mind. We 
can deduce that although he wanted to avoid diffi- 
culties, he always managed to find them and then 
lacked confidence to tackle them. But the less con- 
fidence he had in himself the more he wanted to 
demonstrate that he was worthy of attention. He 
did not cease his mischief-making until the school 
coidd no longer tolerate him and expelled him. 
When one has the justifiable standpoint that the 


 
school cannot permit one sinner to disturb the work 
of ali the other students, there remains nothing else 
to do but expel the sinner. However, when we be- 
lieve that the purpose of education is to correct 
shortcomings, expulsion is not the right method. It 
made it easier for the boy to obtain recognition from 
his mother, and he no longer had to exert himself in 
school. 

It is to be noted here that he was, on the advice of 
one teacher, sent to a home during the vacation 
period. There he was under more strict supervision 
than even at school and this experiment was also a 
failure. His parents, however, were still the chief 
supervisors. The child went home every Sunday — a 
fact which pleased him very much. Yet, when he was 
not allowed to go home, he did not sulk. This is un - 
derstandable. He wanted to play the great man and 
be regarded as such by others. He made no fuss 
about a whipping, did not permit himself to cry, nor 
in any way to behave in an unmanly fashion, no mat- 
ter how disagreeable things were. 

His school report cards were never very had; he 
always had tutoring at home. 

We conclude from this, that he was not inde- 
pendent. The parents were told by the teacher that 


THE EDUCATION OE CHILDREN 
the boy could learn very much better if only he were 
somewhat quieter. We are convinced that the boy 
can learn since there are no children, apart from the 
feeble-minded, who cannot learn. 

He has no talent for drawing. 

This is important since it may be assumed from 
the statement that he has not entirely overcome the 
clumsiness of his right hand. 

He is one of the best in the gymnasium; he learned 
to swim quickly and has no fear of danger. 

That shows that he is not completely discouraged, 
but that he has been using his courage for unimpor- 
tant things — ^for those things which he could do 
easily and in which he was sure of success. 

He is a stranger to shyness and tells every one 
what he thinks ^ no matter whether it happens to he 
the janitor or director of the school^ in spite of the 
fact that he has been admonished time and again not 
to be forward. 

We already know that he pays no attention when 
he is forbidden to do this or that, and we cannot 
therefore accept his lack of shyness as evidence of 
courage. We know that many children are well 


THE EDUCATION OP CHILDREN 
aware of the distance that separates them from the 
teachers and officials of the school This boy who is 
not afraid of being whipped by his father^ is nat- 
urally not afraid of the principal and speaks impu- 
dently in order to make himself important, and in 
this way lie actually achieves his goal. 

Me is not quite certain about Ms seoo, but says fre- 
quently that he wouldn^t like to be a girl. 

There are no definite indications as to his opinion 
of his own sex, but we always find in boys of such 
mischievous character the tendency to degrade girls. 
They derive a sense of their own superiority from 
the degradation of the girls. 

He has no real friends. 

This is quite understandable, since other children 
do not always like to give him the role of leader. 

His parents have not explained sex matters to him 
as yet. His behavior is always an expression of a de- 
sire to rule. 

He himself knows the facts which we have to get 
about him ivith so much effort. That is to say, he 
knows well what he wants, but he unquestionably 
does not know the connection between his uncon- 


 
scious goal aod his behavior. He does not understand 
the extent and origin of this intense desire to rule. 
He wants to rule because he sees his father ruling, 
and the more he wants to rule, the weaker he really 
is, because he has to depend upon others ; while his 
father, wdiom he has taken as a model, rules in a self- 
contained manner. In other words his ambition feeds 
on his weakness. 

He always wants to start something, even with 
those stronger than he is. 

These stronger persons are, hov/ever, weaker be- 
cause they take their duties seriously. The boy only 
trusts himself when he can be impudent. Inciden- 
tally, it will not be easy to rid him of this impudence 
because he has no faith in his ability to learn any- 
thing and, therefore, has to hide behind this im- 
jjudence. 

He is not selfish, he gives freely. 

If one were to assume this to be a sign of good- 
ness, it would be difficult to find the connection with 
the rest of his character. We know that one can show 
superiority by being generous. It is important to see 
how this trait fits in with a lust for power. This gen- 
erosity is felt by him as a personal elevation. It is 


 
probable that he lias learned from his father this 
trick of showing off by being generous. 

He still makes a lot of trouble. He is afraid first 
of all of Ms father j then of his mother. He is ready to 
get wp at any hour and is not particularly 'vain. 

This last concerns outer vanity, since his inner 
vanity is extraordinarily great. 

He has given up the old habit of picking his nose. 
He is a stubborn child, fussy about food, does not 
like vegetables or fats. He is not completely wicom- 
pa7iionable, hut prefers those children with whom he 
can do anything, and, likes animals and flowe?'S very 
much. 

A liking for animals always has as a background 
a striving for superiority, a desire to rule. Such a lik- 
ing is certainly not objectionable since it tends 
toward a union with all things earthly. With such 
children, however, we find that it expresses a wish 
to rule, and always tends to give the mother some- 
thing more to attend to. 

He manifested a great desire for leadership, to be 
sure 7 wt for mtellectual leadership. He developed a 
teiidency to collect things, hut not possessing suf- 
ficient patience, no collection was ever completed. 



THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 


The tragedy of such persons consists in the fact 
that they leave everything unfinished, because they 
are afraid of the responsibility of a completed re- 
sult. 

On the whole Ms behavior has improved since the 
age of ten. It wa^ impossible formerly to keep him in 
the house since he always wanted to play the hero on 
the streets. His improvement has been brought about 
at the cost of great effort. 

To confine him to the narrow limits of the house 
proved in reality the best means of satisfying his 
strong desire for self-assertion. Small wonder that 
he does more mischief within these narrow coniines. 
He should have been left on the street under proper 
supervision. 

When he comes home he turns to his school worh^ 
shows no desire for leaving the house ^ hut finds ways 
for wasting his time. 

We shall always be confronted with distraction 
and time-wasting when we confine a child to such a 
narrow sphere that he has always to work under 
supervision. He must he given an opportunity for 
activity — for joining other children so as to he able 
to play a role among his fellows. 



 

He med to go gladly to school. 

Tills suggests that his teacher was not severe. In 
this way he was easily able to play the part of a hero. 

He used to lose most of his school books. He was 
not afraid of examinations^ he always believed that 
he could do everything brilliantly. 

We find here a rather common trait. The fact that 
a given person is optimistic under all circumstances 
shows that he does not believe in himself. Such per- 
sons are certainly pessimists, but they manage to do 
violence to logic, taking refuge in a dream world 
where they can attain everything; they display no 
signs of surprise when they are confronted with de- 
feat. They are possessed of a feeling of predestina- 
tion enabling them to appear as optimists. 

He sufers from a great lack of concentration. He 
is liked by some teachers and greatly disliked by 
others. 

In any case he seems to be liked by the milder 
teachers who are pleased with his manners. He also 
disturbs them less, because no difficult tasks are as- 
signed to him. Like most spoiled children, he lacks 
either the inclination or the habit of concentration. 
Up to the age of six he felt no need for this, since 


 
his mother took care of everything. Everything in 
life had been prearranged, as if he were enclosed in 
a cage. His lack of preparation made itself felt as 
soon as he was confronted with difficulties. He had 
acquired no means for meeting difficulties, he had 
no interest in others so as to be able to co-operate 
with them. He had neither the desire nor the self- 
confidence necessary to accomplish something inde- 
pendently. What he possessed was the desire for 
prominence — the desire to get to the front without 
any effort. But he failed to disturb the peace of 
the school — ^iie failed to get attention, and this made 
his character worse. 

He always wanted to take everything easily, and 
get everything in the easiest way without regard for 
other people. This had become the dominant motif of 
his life, which was expressed in ail his specific acts, 
such as thefts and lies. 

The mistake underlying the development of his 
life style is obvious. His mother, to be sure, supplied 
him with a stimulus for developing his social senti- 
ments, but neither his mother nor his stern father 
succeeded in determining* their further course. These 
sentiments were confined to the world of Ms mother. 
In his mother’s presence he felt himself to be the 
center of attention. 





 

His striving for superiority was thus no longer 
directed towards the useful side of life but towards 
the vanity of liis own person. In order to bring him 
to the useful side of life, the development of liis char- 
acter must be started anew. His confidence must be 
gained, so that he would gladly listen to us. At the 
same time we must widen the sphere of his social re- 
lations and in this way make good what the mother 
failed to do with the only child. He will have to be 
reconciled with his father. His education has to pro- 
ceed step by step until the boy will be able to under- 
stand the mistake of his past life stjde in the same 
way that we understand it. Since his interest will no 
longer be focussed upon a single person, his inde- 
pendence and courage will grow and he will direct 
his superiority striving towards the useful side of 
life. 

II 

This is a case of a ten-year-old boy. 

! T/ie complaint of the school is that his work is poor 
and that he is three terms behind. 

Ten years old and three terms behind — we would 
suspect that he is feeble-minded. 



 


Me is now in SB. His I. Q. is 101. 

He therefore cannot be feeble-minded. What can 
be the cause of his backwardness? Why does lie cor- 
rupt the class? We see a certain striving and a cer- 
tain activity on his part, but all on the useless side. 
He wants to be creative, active and the center of at- 
tention, but in the wrong way. We can also see that 
he fights the school. He is a fighter. He is an enemy 
to the school, and, therefore, we understand why he 
should be backward, the routine of the school is very 
difficult for such a fighter. 

He is slow to obey commands. 

This is very obvious. He acts intelligently, that is 
to say, there is a method in his madness. If he is a 
fighter then he has to resist commands. 

He fights with other boys; he brings toys to school. 

He wants to make his own school. 

He is had in oral arithmetic. 

This means that he lacks social-mindedness and 
the social logic that goes with it ( See Chapter VII) . 

He has a speech defect and goes to a speech class 
once a week. 


 

This speech defect is not based on an organic de- 
ficieiicy» This is a symptom of a lack of social co- 
operations which shows itself in his impeded speech. 
Language is an attitude of co-operation — ^the indi- 
vidua! has to connect himself with another person. 
As things are, the boy uses this speech defect as a 
tool for his combativeness. We need not wonder that 
he does not seek to remedy this speech defect, for to 
remedy it means to give up this tool with which he 
attracts attention. 

When the teacher talks to him he moves his body 
from side to side. 

It is as if he were preparing an attack. He does 
not enjoy having the teacher speak to him, because 
he is not the center of attention. The teacher is the 
conqueror if she speaks and he has to listen. 

The mother (to be exact, the stepmother, since the 
mother died in his infancy) only complains that he is 
nervous. 

This mysterious idea of nervousness covers a mul- 
titude of sins. 

He was brought up by two grandmothers. 

One grandmother is bad enough — ^we know that 
grandmothers usually pamper the children in a ter- 


 
rible way. It is worth while to consider why they do 
it. It is the fault of our culture — ^there is no place for 
older women. They rebel against this treatment and 
want to be treated rightly — wherein they are quite 
right. The grandmother wants to prove the impor- 
tance of her existence and she does this by pamper- 
ing the children and getting them to cling to her. In 
this way she asserts her right to be recognized as a 
personality. 

If you hear that there are two grandmothers then 
you can understand that there is a terrible competi- 
tion going on. One will want to prove that the chil- 
dren like her more than the other. Naturally, under 
this competition for its favor the child finds himself 
in a sort of paradise where he gets everything he 
wants. All he needs to say is, “The other grand- 
mother gave me this,” and the other will want to out- 
bid her rival. At home this child is the center of at- 
tention, and we can see how he makes this attention 
his goal. Now he is in school where there are not two 
grandmothers — there is only one teacher and many 
children. The only way he can be the center of at- 
tention here is by fighting. 

During the time he was living with the grand- 
mothers he did not get good marks at school, 



 

The school was not the right place for him. He 
was not prepared for it. The school was a test of his 
ability to co-operate, and he was not trained for it. A 
mother is the one who can best develop this ability 
for co-operation. 

The father rem.arried a year and a half ago and 
the child lives with the father and stepmother. 

Here "^ve find, of course, a difficult situation. The 
trouble begins or the trouble is increased when a 
stepmother or stepfather enters into the situation. 
The problem of step-parents is traditional and it 
has not yet been improved; the child especially 
suffers. Stepmothers, even of the best kind, gen- 
erally have trouble. One need not say that the 
problem of step-parents is insoluble, but it can be 
solved only in a certain manner. Stepmothers and 
stepfathers should not expect appreciation as their 
right, but they should try their best to win ap- 
preciation. With two grandmothers to complicate 
the situation, the difficulty of the stepmother with the 
child is increased. 

The step)mother tried to be affectionate when she 
first came into the family. She did all she could to 
win the boy. An older brother is a problem also. 



THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 

Another fighter in the family, and think of the 
terrible rivalry between the two brothers which 
only increases the general combativeness. 

The child fears the father and obeys him, but 
he does not obey the mother. Therefore she reports 
him to the father. 

This is reaUy a confession that the mother can- 
not educate the child, and so she puts it up to the 
man. When the mother always reports to the father 
what the children do and do not do, when she 
menaces them with the words, “I will tell your 
father,” the children understand that she is not 
able to manage them and has given up the job. So 
they look for occasions to boss her. When the 
mother speaks and acts in this way she expresses 
her inferiority complex. 

Mother will take him out to places and buy him 
things if he promises to behave. 

The mother is in a difficult situation. Why ? Be- 
cause the grandmother overshadows her, as the 
children think the grandmother is more important. 

The grandmother sees him only occasionally. 

It is very easy for a person who comes only for a 


 
few hours to meddle with the children and leave 
all the trouble for the mothero 

There does not seem to he any one in the family 
who really loves the child. 

It appears that they do not like him any more. 
After spoiling him by pampering, even the grand- 
mother now dislikes him. 

The father whips him. 

The whipping does not help, however. The child 
likes praise and if praised he is always wholly con- 
tented. But he does not know how to earn praise 
by acting in a right way. He prefers to demand 
praise from the teacher without earning it. 

He works better if he receives praise. 

This is of course the case with all children who 
want to be the center of attention. 

Teachers do not like him because he is sullen. 

This is the best means he could use, because he 
is a fighter. 

The child suffers from enuresis. 

This is also an expression of his desire to be the 


 


center of attention. He is not fighting in a direct 
way but in an indirect way. How can such a child 
fight his mother in an indirect way? By wetting 
the bed and making her get up in the middle of the 
night; by screaming out in the night; by reading 
in bed instead of going to sleep ; by not getting up 
in the morning; by bad eating habits. In short, he 
always has some means to occupy the mother with 
him, both in the daytime and at night. Enuresis 
and speech defect — with these two weapons he 
fights the environment. 


The mother has tried to rid him of this habit by 
waking him several times in the night. 

The mother is therefore with him several times in 
the night. Thus, even in this way he attains his goal. 


Children are not fond of the boy because he 
wants to boss them. A few weak ones try to imitate 
him. 

He is a weak and discouraged person, and does 
not want to carry on in a courageous manner. The 
weak children in the school like to imitate him be- 
cause this is really the right way for weak children 
to gain attention. 




 

On the other hand, he is not really disliked, and 
"dke other children are glad to think that he has 
improved whenever his work is chosen as the best.'" 

Tlie cMIdren are glad when he improves. This is 
also a very good indication about the teacher. The 
teacher really understands how to make the eO“ 
operative spirit live in the children. 

The hoy likes to play hall on the street with other 
children. 

He has relations with others when he is sure to 
succeed and conquer. 

The case was discussed with the mother and it 
was explained to her that she was in a very difficult 
situation with the child and the grandmothers. It 
was also explained to her that the boy is jealous 
of the older brother and is always afraid that he 
may be left behind. During the interview the boy 
did not speak a word although he was told that we 
were all his friends at the clinic. Speech for this 
boy would mean co-operation. He wants to fight, 
and so instead of speaking he refrains from speak- 
ing. It is the same lack of social-mindedness which 
we saw expressed in his refusal to do anything 
about his speech defect. 

This may seem astonishing, but it is a fact that 


 
we very often find even adult persons who act this 
way in social life — ^they fight by not speaking. 
There was once a couple who had a violent quarrel. 
The husband screamed very loudly and said to his 
wife, “Just see, now you are silent!” She replied, 
“I am not silent, I only do not speak!” 

In the case of this boy he, too, “only does not 
speak.” When the interview was over he was told 
that he could go but he did not seem to want to 
leave. He was antagonized. He was told that the 
discussion was over and still he did not go. He was 
told to come again with the father next week. 

In the meantime, we said to him. “You acted 
quite rightly not to speak since you always do the 
contrary thing. If you are told to speak, you are 
silent; when you should be silent in school, then you 
corrupt the class by your talking. You believe that 
in this way you are a hero. If we told you, ‘Don’t 
speak at all!’ then you would speak. We only need 
to lead you on and ask the contrary of what we 
want.” 

The child obviously could be made to speak be- 
cause it would be necessary for him to answer ques- 
tions. In this way he would co-operate by speech 
and language. Later on the situation could be ex- 
plained to him and he could be convinced of his 


 

mistakes, and in this way gradually improved. 

In this connection, it should be borne in mind 
that so long as such a child is in his old accustomed 
situation he has no incentive to change. The mother, 
father, grandmothers, teachers, comrades — all fit 
into his accustomed life-style. His attitudes are 
fixed in respect to them. But when he comes to the 
clinic it is an altogether new situation that con- 
fronts him. We must even try to make this new 
situation as new as possible — a totally new environ- 
ment in fact. He will better reveal the character 
traits belonging to the old situation to which he is 
trained. It is a good idea in such a case to tell him 
“you must not speak at all!” Whereupon he will 
say, “I will speak!” In this way nobody has en- 
tered into conversation with him directly, and he is 
not on guai’d with his inhibitions. 

At the clinic, the children generally stand before 
a large audience, and this impresses them very 
much. It is a new situation and it gives the impres- 
sion that they are not only not tied up with their 
own small environment but that others are also 
interested, and that they are thus a part of a larger 
whole. All this makes them want to be more a part 
of the whole than before, especially if they are 
asked to come again. They know what will happen 


 
— they will be questioned and asked how they are 
getting on, etc. Some come once a week and some 
come every day depending on the nature of the 
case. They are trained for their behavior toward 
the teacher. They know that they will not be accused, 
reproached or criticized, but that everything will be 
judged as if through an open window. This always 
impresses people. If a couple have a quarrel and 
some one opens a window, the quarrel stops, and 
it is a wholly different situation. When a window 
is open and they can be heard, people do not want 
to give expression to their mistaken character 
traits. This is one step forward, and this is made 
when children come to the clinic. 

HI 

This is the case of an oldest child, thirteen and a 
half years old. 

At the age of eleven he had I. Q. 0 / 140. 

It might, therefore, be said that this is a bright 
child. 

Since he entered the second term of high school 
he has made very little progress. 

From experience we know that if a child be- 


 
lieves lie is bright, lie very often expects every- 
thing without effort, and the consequence is that 
siicli children are very often brought to a stop. 
We find, for instance that these children in the 
period of adolescence feel they are much more 
grown up than they really are. They want to prove 
that they are not children any more. The more 
they attempt to express themselves, the more 
they meet the difficulties of real life. They then 
begin to doubt whether they are really as clever as 
they have hitherto regarded themselves. It is not 
advisable to tell a child he is bright or that he has 
an I. Q. of 140. Children should never know their 
I. Q. and neither should the parents. All this ex- 
plains why such a bright child should fail later. 
It is a situation fraught with danger. A child who 
is very ambitious and who is not sure of having a 
success in the right way, will look for a wrong way 
in which to be successful. Some of these wrong 
ways are : to become neurotic, to commit suicide, to 
commit crimes, to become lazy or to waste time. 
There are a hundred varieties of alibis that chil- 
dren use in order to be successful in a useless way. 

Favorite subject is science. Associates with boys 
younger than hiniself. 




 

We know that children join with younger chil- 
dren in order to have things easier; in order to be 
superior and be the leader. It is a suspicious sign 
if children like to associate with younger children, 
although it need not always be so — sometimes the 
attitude is that of a father. But there is always a 
certain weakness involved, because the expression 
of a paternal instinct involves the exclusion of play 
with older children. This exclusion is a conscious 
act. 

Likes football and baseball. 

We can presuppose, therefore, that he is very 
good in these games. Probably we shall hear that 
he is quite good in certain directions, but in some 
things not even interested. It means that wherever 
he is sure of success, there he will be active ; wher- 
ever he is not sure of success, he refuses to par- 
ticipate. This is of course not the right way to act. 

Plays cards. 

That means wasting time. 

This seems to take his attention away from the 
iirsual routine of going to bed early and doing his 
home work in the proper time, 



 

Now we are coming to real complaints and these 
are ail focused on the same point. He cannot go 
ahead in liis studies and he therefore simply wastes 
time. 

As an infant he developed slowly. After two 
years he began to develop rapidly. 

In these two years we do not know why be de- 
veloped slowly. He was probably pampered and 
what we have is the result of a pampered child- 
hood. The slow development might have been due 
to this pampering. We see pampered children 
who do not want to speak or move or function be- 
cause they like being supported, and they are thus 
not stimulated to develop. But when he develops 
rapidly the only explanation is that there was a 
stimulus for development. Probably there was some 
strong stimulus that made him a bright and intel- 
ligent child. 

Outstanding features are honesty and stubborn- 
ness. 

It is not enough for us that he is honest. It is all 
very nice and is really an advantage, but we do not 
know if he does not use this honesty in order to 
criticize others. It may very well be a way for him 


 
to boast. We know that he is a person who likes 
to lead and to boss others, and this honesty could 
be an expression of his superiority striving. We 
are not sure whether if this hoy were in an unfavor- 
able situation he could continue to be honest. As re- 
gards his stubbornness, we find that he really wants 
his own way and likes to be different and not led by 
others. 

He hulUes Ms younger brother. 

In this statement our judgment is confirmed. 
He wants to be a leader, and because his younger 
brother does not obey he bullies him. This is not 
very honest and you will find, if you really know 
him, that he is something of a liar. He is a boasting 
person and we see his feeling of superiority. What 
is expressed here is really a superiority complex, 
but this superiority complex shows clearly that he 
is at bottom suffering from a sense of inferiority. 
He undervalues himself because overvalued by 
others, and because he undervalues himself, he has to 
make up for it by boasting. It is not wise to praise a 
child too much because then he gets the idea that 
much is expected of him. When he does not find it 
easy to meet expectations, he begins to tremble and 
to be afraid, and the result is that he will organize his 


 
life so that Hs weakness will not be discovered. Ergo, 
he bullies his brother, etc. This is his style of life. He 
does not feel strong enough and confident enough 
to solve the problems of life independently and 
properly. Hence his passion for playing cards. 
When he plays cards nobody can discover his in- 
feriority, even if he has bad school reports. The 
parents would say his bad reports are due to the 
fact that lie always plays cards, and in this way his 
pride and vanity are saved. He becomes imbued 
with this idea: “Yes, because I like cards I am not 
a good pupil ; if I did not play cards I would be the 
best pupil. But, I play cards.” He is satisfied, 
and he has the comfortable feeling that he could 
be the best. As long as this boy does not under- 
stand the logic of his own psychology he can wail 
to himself and hide his feeling of inferiority both 
from himself and from others. And so long as he 
can do this, he will not change. Hence, in a very 
friendly manner, we must reveal to him the springs 
of his character and show him that he really acts 
like a person who does not feel strong enough to 
accomplish his work. He feels strong enough only 
to hide his feeling of weakness, his feeling of in- 
feriority. This should be done as we have said, in 
a friendly manner and with constant encourage- 


 
nieiit. We should not always praise him and wa¥e 
his high I. Q. before him — constant reminder 
was probably what made him afraid he might not 
always have success. We know quite well that later 
in life the I. Q. is not very important ; all good ex- 
perimental psychologists know that an I. Q. can 
only show a present situation as revealed in the test 
and that life is too complicated and cannot be 
known in a test. A high I. Q. is no proof that a 
child is really able to solve all the problems of life. 

The boy’s real difficulty is his lack of social- 
mindedness and his feeling of inferiority. And this 
must be explained to him. 

IV 

This is the case of a boy eight and a half years 
old. This case illustrates how children are pam- 
pered. Criminal and neurotic types spring chiefly 
from the class of pampered children. The great 
need of our age is that we stop pampering children. 
This does not mean that we have to stop liking 
them, but it means that we have to stop indulging 
them. We should treat them like friends and equals. 
This case is valuable for the way it portrays the 
features of a pampered child. 



 

Present problem: Mepeated every grade in school 
and is now only in the 2 A grade. 

A child who repeats classes in the first years of 
school may very well be suspected of feeble- 
mindedness. We must keep that possibility in mind 
in our analysis. On the other hand, with a child 
who starts out well and then slumps, feeble-minded- 
ness may be ruled out. 

Talks haby talk. 

He wants to be pampered: therefore be imitates 
a baby. But this means that he must have a purpose 
and goal in mind, since he regards it as an ad- 
vantage to act like a baby. The existence of a 
rational conscious plan in this case rules out feeble- 
mindedness. He did not like school work as he was 
not prepared for school. And so, instead of de- 
veloping along social lines in school, he expresses 
his striving by antagonizing and fighting the en- 
vironment. This attitude of antagonism is of course 
paid for by his being left back in every class. 

Disobeys and fights badly with the older brother. 

Hence we see that the older brother is for him 
a hindrance. From this we can presuppose that the 
older brother must be a good pupil. The only way 


 
he can compete with his older brother is by being 
bad. Also in his dream life he imagines he would 
be ahead of his brother if he were a baby. 

Walked at twenty-two months. 

He probably suffered from rickets. If he did not 
walk until twenty-two months then it is also prob- 
able that he was always watched, and that his 
mother was with him continually during these 
twenty-two months. We can see how this organic 
imperfection has been a stimulus for the mother to 
watch him more and pamper him. 

He talked early. 

Now we are sure that he is not feeble-minded. 
Feeble-mindedness is expressed largely in the dif- 
ficulty of learning to speak. 

He always talks hahy talk. The father is very 
affectionate. 

He also pampers him. 

He ijrefers the mother. There are two hoys in 
the family. Mother says the older hoy is clever. 
The two hoys fight a great deal. 

It is a case of rivalry of children in the family. 



 
It is present in most families, especially between 
the first two children in the family, but there is 
often rivalry between any two children 'who grow 
up together. The psychology of the situation is the 
fact that when another child comes along, the first 
is dethroned, and, as we have seen (Chap. 8) the 
situation can be prevented only if children are 
properly prepared for co-operation. 

Me does poorly in arithmetic. 

The greatest difficulty in school for the pam- 
pered child is usually arithmetic, for arithmetic in- 
volves a certain social logic which pampered children 
do not have. 

There must he something wrong with his head. 

We cannot find it. He acts quite intelligently. 

The mother and teacher believe that he mastur- 
bates. 

It is possible that he does. Most children do 

masturbate. 

The mother says he has dark rings under his eyes. 

We cannot properly conclude to the practice of 


 


masturbation from the presence of rings under the 
eyes, although people generally are suspicious of it. 

He is very finicky in eating. 

We see how he always wants to occupy his 
mother, even in connection with his eating. 

He is afraid of the dark. 

Being afraid of the dark is also a sign of a pam- 
pered childhood. 

The child's mother says he has a lot of friends. 

We believe they are the ones he can boss. 

He is mt crested in music. 

It is instructive to examine the external ear 
among musical persons. One finds that the ear of a 
musical person has better developed curves. When 
we saw this boy we were positive that he had a fine 
and sensitive ear. This sensitiveness may express 
itself in a liking for harmony, and the person that 
possesses it may have a greater capacity for musical 
training. 

He likes to sing^ hut he has ear trouble. 

Such persons cannot easily endure our noisy life. 
Among such persons the tendency to ear infections 


 
is greater than among others. The formation of 
the auditor}?' organ is inherited, and that is why 
both musical talent and ear trouble are passed on 
from generation to generation. This boy is suffer- 
ing from ear trouble and in his family are some 
very musical persons. 

The proper course of treatment for the boy is to 
try to make him more independent and self-reliant. 
At present he is not self-reliant, but believes that 
it is necessary for his mother always to occupy 
herself with him and never to leave him alone. He 
is always wanting to be supported by the mother, 
and mothers are of course only too glad to give this 
support. He is now to be free to do what he wants 
— ^free to make mistakes. For it is only in this way 
that he can learn self-reliance. He is to learn not 
to compete with his brother for his mother’s favor. 
At present each brother feels that the other is pre- 
ferred, and each one is therefore needlessly jealous 
of the other. 

What is especially necessary is to make the boy 
courageous enough to face the problems of school 
life. For, think what will happen if he does not 
continue at school. The moment he breaks with 
school he will have deviated to the useless side of 
life. One day he will play hookey from school, 


THE EDUCATION OE CHILDREN 
another day he will stop school altogether, disap- 
pear from home and join a gang. An ounce of pre- 
vention is worth a pound of cure; it is better to 
adjust him now to school life than to have to deal 
later -with a juvenile delinquent. The school is now’' 
the crucial test. At present he is not prepared to 
solve problems in a social way and that is why lie 
has difficulties at school. But it is up to the school 
to give him new courage. Of course the school lias 
its own problems: perhaps the classes are over- 
crowded, and perhaps the teachers that he has come 
across are not well prepared for this work of psy- 
chological encouragement. That is the tragedy of 
things. But if this boy can hud a single teacher 
who can encourage and hearten him properly, then 
he will be saved. 

v 

A case history of a girl ten years of age. 

It ef erred to the clinic from school because of 
difficulties with arithmetic and spelling, 

Ai’ithmetic is usually a difficult subject for a 
pampered child. There is no rule that pampered 
children must be bad pupils in arithmetic, but we 
have very often found this to be our experience. 



 
We know that very often left-handed children have 
difficulties in spelling because they are trained to 
look from the right to the left side and when they 
read they read from the right to the left. They read 
and spell correctly^ but reverse. Usually nobody un- 
derstands that they read in the right way, only 
reverse. They know only that they cannot read and 
they will simply say that they cannot read or spell 
correctly. Thus we suspect that the girl may 
be left-handed. Perhaps there is another reason 
why she has difficulties in spelling. In New York 
we must think of the possibility that perhaps she 
is from another country, and therefore does not 
understand English properly. In Europe we do 
not have to take such a thought into account. 

Important points in past history: The family 
lost most of its money in Germany. 

We do not know when they came from Germany. 
This girl probably had once experienced good 
times which suddenly came to an end. This is al- 
ways a new situation which is like a test. In this 
new situation it will be revealed whether she has 
been rightly trained for co-operation and whether 
she is socially adjusted and courageous. It will also 
be revealed whether or not she can bear the burden 


 
of being poor — which means in other words, 
whether she can co-operate. It seems that she can- 
not co-operate properly. 

She was a good pupil in Germany, and was eight 
years old when she left Germany. 

This was two years ago. 

She does not get along well in school here be- 
cause the spelling is difficult and arithmetic is not 
taught in the same way as in Germany. 

The teacher does not always make allowances 
for this. 

Pampered by the mother, to whom she is very 
much attached. Likes both parents the same. 

If you ask children the question “Whom do you 
prefer, your mother or your father?” they will gen- 
erally give the answer, ‘T like them both the 
same!” They are taught to give this answer to such 
a question. There are many w'ays to test the truth 
of this answer. A good way is to put the child be- 
tween the two parents and when we speak to the 
parents the child will move towards the one to 
whom she is most attached. We can see the same 
thing when the parents are in a room and the child 


 
enters. Again she will go to the one to whom she 
is most attached. 

She IiG^ a few girl friends of her own age, but 
not many. Marliest remembrances: At the age of 
eight she was in the country with her parents and 
used to play with a dog in the grass. They also had 
a carriage at this time. 

She remembers her riches, the grass, the dog and 
the carriage. It is the same as with a man who was 
formerly rich and always looks back to the days 
when he had a car, horses, a fine house, servants, 
etc. We can understand that she does not feel con- 
tented. 

Dreams about Christmas and what Santa Claus 
will bring her. 

Her dream life expresses the same outlook as her 
waking life. She always wants to have more be- 
cause she feels deprived and wants to regain what 
she has had in the past. 

Leans on the mother. 

This is a sign of her discouragement and of her 
difficulties at school. It was explained to her that 
things were harder for her than for the other chil- 
dren and that she could learn by studying more 
and by being courageous. 



THE EDUCATION OP CHILDREN 

She came to the clinic again, ^without her mother. 
She is getting along a little better in school and 
has been doing everything alone at home. 

She was advised to be independent, not to de- 
pend upon the mother and do everything alone. 

She cooked breakfast for father. 

This is a sign of a sense of developing co- 
operation. 

She believes she is more courageous, and seemed 
to be more at ease in this interview. 

She is to return and bring the mother. 

She retm’ned with the mother, who came for the 
first time. The mother had been working hard and 
could not get away before. She reports that the 
child is a foster child and was adopted when two 
years old, and does not know that she is a foster 
child. In her first two years she was in six dif event 
places. 

This is not a nice past. It seems as though this 
girl suffered very much in the first two years» 
Thus we have to do with a child who was probably 
once hated and neglected and then came into the 
good care of this woman. The child wants to cling 
to this favorable situation because of the micon- 


THE EDUCATION OE CHILDREN 
scions impression in her mind of her early had ex- 
periences. Ill two years a child can be very much 
impressed. 

fVhen the mother took the child she was told that 
she must he very strict as the child^s family was not 
a good one. 

The person who gave this advice was poisoned 
with the idea of heredity.. If she should be strict 
and the girl should turn out a problem child then 
the judge would say, “You see, I am right!” He 
would not know that he is the guilty one. 

The mother xms bad and the foster mother feels 
a greater responsibility for the girl because she is 
not her own child. She sometimes hits the child. 

The situation is not so favorable as before. The 
pampering attitude ceases sometimes and instead 
she is punished. 

The father pampers the child and gives her what- 
ever she wants. If she wants something she will 
not say ^'please'" or ‘Hhank youT She says "‘you 
are not my mother."^ 

Either the child knows the fact or uses a phrase 
which hits the right spot. We know of a hoy of 
twenty, who does not believe his mother is his real 


 
mot!iei% and yet the parents swear that the child 
could not know it. Evidently he had such a feel- 
ing. Children form conclusions out of very small 
tilings. “The child does not know she is adopted,” 
hut sometimes they feel it. 

She says this to the mother hut not to the father. 

The father does not give her a chance to attack 
him in that way because he gives her everything. 

The mother cannot understand the change at the 
new school. Now she has a bad report card and 
she has had to hit her. 

The poor child has a bad report card, she is 
humiliated and feels inferior, and then the mother 
spanks her — it is too much. Even one of these two 
things would be too much — either to be spanked 
or to get a bad school report. This is a matter 
to be considered by the teachers, who should realize 
that when they give children bad school reports, 
it is the beginning of more trouble at home. A wise 
teacher would avoid giving bad school reports if 
she knew that the bad reports would be an occasion 
for the mother to spank the child. 

The child says that she sometimes forgets herself 
and has an outhtirst of temper. She is excited at 



 
school and corrupts the class. She believes she must 
always be the first. 

Vfe can understand this desire in an only ehild 
trained by the father to get everything that she 
wants. We can understand that she likes to be the 
first. W e know that in the past she had the country 
fields, etc., and that she feels deprived of her past 
advantages. Now her superiority striving is much 
stronger, hut as she has no channels for its expres- 
sion, she forgets herself and makes trouble. 

It was explained to her that she must learn to 
co-operate. We told her that she gets excited in 
order to be the center of attention, and that her 
outbursts of temper are only an excuse to get 
everybody to look at her. She does not work in 
school because her mother is angry with her reports 
and she is fighting the mother. 

Dreams that Santa Claus brought her many 
things. Then she awakes and finds nothing. 

Here again she wants always to arouse such 
feelings and emotions of having everything that 
she wants and “awakes and finds nothing,” We 
must not overlook the snake in the grass. If we 
arouse such feelings and emotions in a dream and 
awake and see nothing, then we will naturally feel 



 
disappointed. Yet the dream arouses only the feel- 
ings which are consistent with the attitude after 
awakening. In other words, the emotional goal of 
the dreams is not the arousing of marvelous feel- 
ings of possessing everything — the emotional goal 
is precisely, to be disappointed. It is for this pur- 
pose that the dreams are created until the goal is 
satisfied and the disappointment takes place. In 
melancholia, persons have marvelous dreams but 
awake and find things quite the contrary. We can 
understand why this girl w^ants to be disappointed. 
She wants to accuse the mother since her present 
life must appear to her in very dark colors. She 
feels that she has nothing and the mother does not 
give her anything. “She spanks me; only father 
gives me things.” 

Summing up this case we can see that the child 
always wants to be disappointed so that she can 
accuse the mother. She is fighting the mother and 
if we want to stop this fight, we must be able to 
convince her that her behavior at home, her dreams 
and her behavior at school are all of the same mis- 
taken pattern. Her mistaken style of life is largely 
the result of the fact that she has been only a short 
time ill America, and is not very well trained in the 
English language. We must therefore convince 


 
her that these difficulties could be easily overcome, 
but that she is deliberately using them as a weapon 
with which to fight her mother. We must also influ- 
ence the mother to stop spanking the child, so as 
not to give her an excuse for fighting. The child 
must be brought to realize that “I am not attentive 
and forget myself, and have outbursts of temper 
because I want to have trouble with my mother.” 
If she knows this, then she can stop her bad be- 
havior, Before she knew the meaning of all the 
experiences and impressions in her home and school 
life and in her dreams, a change of character was 
of course out of the question. 

And so we see what Psychology is — to under- 
stand the use a person makes of his impressions 
and experiences. Or, in other words. Psychology 
means to understand the scheme of apperception 
by which the child acts and by which he reacts to 
stimuli, to understand how he regards certain 
stimuli, how he responds to them, and how he uses 
them for his own purposes.

Guiding the Child 

This book, now in its third impression, was the result of exper- 
ience gained by a group of physicians and teachers who, during 
the 1920’s, organised a number of child guidance clinics in differ- 
ent parts of Europe, under the leadership and inspiration of Alfred 
Adler. 

It is not a symposium but an organised and connected account of 
the problems, accomplishments and failures encountered in daily 
work, reported from actual experience by the experts in charge. 
Adler edited the volume and directed the work, making his own 
contribution, so that there should be no omission or repetition. It 
makes a closely knit account of inestimable value to the welfare

Adler's Place in Psychology mill leave no one in any doubt as to 
what is really the voice of Alfred Adler in the field of psychology 
and what has been so often, both before and since his death, the 
easy plagiarism of less gifted minds. 

A scholar, dealing with his subject in a deeply studied language, 
which has the merit of being his mother tongue, Lewis Way has 
written this account of Adler’s Individual Psychology, with 
clarity, open-mindedness and gusto. Lewis Way was himself a 
student and personal friend of Adler’s, and is therefore in a good 
position to understand not only individual psychology as a subject, 
but Adler as a man. 

Any ordinary layman can read this book with pleasure and even 
amusement, while a scholar seeking accurate information as to 
Adler’s theories and their origin, can come away from it both

fact that emotional conflicts produce bodily disease. Writing on 
the war on nerves, he says, “Half the battle is to understand what 
it is all about. The other half is to do something positive about it.” 
He follows this up by giving clearly defined help on both these
