CHAPTER ELETEN 


INFLUENCES FROM OUTSIDE 

T he psychological and educational outlook 
of Individual Psychology is broad enough 
not to neglect the consideration of “influences from 
outside.” The old type of introspective psychology 
was so narrow that, in order to take care of the fact 
it had left out, Wundt found it necessary to invent 
a new science, Social Psychology. This is not nee- 
essary with Individual Psychology, which is at one 
and the same time individual and social. It does not 
concentrate upon the individual mind to the exclu- 
sion of the environment which stimulates the mind, 
nor upon the environment to the exclusion of its 
significance to particular minds. 

No educator or teacher ^should believe that he 
is the only educator of a child. The waves of out- 
side influence stream into the psyches of the chil- 
dren and mould the children directly or indirectly 
— that is to say, by influencing the parents and 
bringing them to a certain state of mind which is 


THE EDUCATION OE CHILDREN 
transferred to the children. All this cannot he 
aYoided, and it must therefore be taken into aC“ 
count. 

First of all the educator must take into account 
economic circumstances. We must remember j for 
examples that there are families living for genera- 
tion upon generation under very pressing circum- 
stances — families that cany on their struggle with 
a sense of bitterness and sorrow. They are so much 
affected by this sorrow and bitterness that they 
cannot educate the child to take a healthy and co- 
operative attitude. They are living on the limits of 
the human mind, where human beings cannot work 
along co-operative lines because they are always 
panic-stricken. 

And then, too, we must not forget that a long 
period of semi-starvation or bad economic circum- 
stances influences the physical life of both parents 
and children, and this in turn has an important 
psychological impact. We see this in the children 
born in postwar Europe. They are much more dif- 
ficult to bring up than previous generations. 
Besides economic circumstances and their effect on 
child development, we must not forget the effect 
of parental ignorance of physical hygiene. This 
ignorance goes hand in hand with the timid and 


 
coddling attitude of parents. Parents want to pam- 
per the children and are afraid to cause them any 
pain. Sometimes they are careless, and they im- 
agine, for example, that a curvature of the spine 
would be outgrown. They do not call for the doc- 
tor at the right time. This is, of course, a mistake, 
especially in cities where medical service is always 
available. A bad physical condition if not cor- 
rected in time may lead to a severe and dangerous 
illness, which may leave bad psychological scars. 
All illness is always a “dangerous corner” psycho- 
logically, and is to be avoided as much as possible. 

If these dangerous corners cannot be avoided 
they can be made much less dangerous by develop- 
ing in children the attitude of courage and social- 
mindedness. In fact it may be said that a child is 
psychologically affected by illness only in so far as 
he is not social-minded. A child that is brought up 
in an environment in which he feels himself a part 
of the whole will not be affected by a dangerous 
illness as would a pampered child. 

Case histories often show the beginning of psy- 
chological troubles after such diseases as whoop- 
ing cough, encephalitis, chorea, etc. One imagines 
that it is these illnesses which are the causes of 
psychological difficulties. But they are really only 


 
the occasions that bring out the hidden character 
flaws in the child. During his illness the child feels 
his powers, and discovers how he can rule the fam- 
ify. He lias seen terror and anxietj’^ on the parents’ 
faces during the illness, and knows that it is all 
on his account. After the illness lie wants to con- 
tiiiiie to be the center of attention, and does this 
by trying to dominate the parents with his whims 
and demands. This, of course, happens with a child 
who has never been socially trained and needs only 
the occasion to manifest his egoistic strivings. 

On the other hand it is interesting to note that 
sometimes an illness may be the occasion of an im- 
provement in the character of the child. There is 
the case of a second child of a school-teacher. The 
teacher had been very much concerned over this 
boy, and had not known what to do with him. He 
would run away from home at times, and was al- 
ways the worst pupil in his class at school. One 
day, just as the father was about to send him away 
to a reformatory, the bpy was discovered to be suf- 
fering from tuberculosis of the hip. This is a dis- 
ease which requires the constant care of the parents 
over a long period. Wben the boy finally recovered, 
he became the best child in the family. All that the 
boy needed was the extra attention from the par- 


 
ents that was provided by the illness. The reason he 
had been disobedient before was because lie had 
always felt himself to be in the shadow of a bril- 
liant older brother. Since he could not be appre- 
ciated like his brother, he was always fighting. But 
the illness convinced him that he, too, could be ap- 
preciated by his parents in the way that his older 
brother was, and so he learned to behave well. 

As regards illness there is also to be noted that 
children’s minds are often deeply impressed with 
the memory of the illnesses they have gone through. 
Children are surprised and astonished that there 
can be such things as dangerous illness and death. 
The mark that is left on their minds comes out 
later on in life, for we find many persons who are 
interested only in sickness and death. Part of these 
persons have found the right way to harness their 
interest in sickness — ^they may be doctors or nurses. 
But many others are always trembling, and sick- 
ness becomes an obsession with them which stands 
in the way of their useful wgrk. An examination of 
the biogi’aphies of more than a hundred girls re- 
vealed that nearly fifty per cent confess that the 
gxeatest fear they have in life is the thought of 
illness and death. 

Parents should see to it that children are not too 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEExV 
niiicli impressed by tbeir childhood sicknesses. 
They should prepare their minds for soch facts and 
spare them sudden shocks. They should give them 
the impression that life is limited but yet long 
enough to be worth while. 

Another “dangerous comer” of childhood life is 
the meeting with strangers, acquaintances or 
friends of the family. The mistakes that are made 
in the encounters with such persons are due to the 
fact that such persons are not really interested in 
the children. They like to amuse the children or do 
things which can influence them very much in a 
short time. They praise the children very highly, 
and thus get them to be conceited. In the short time 
they are with them they manage to pamper them 
and thus to make trouble for their regular educa- 
tors. All this should be avoided. No stranger should 
interfere in the educational methods of the parents. 

Again, strangers very often misunderstand the 
sex of a child and call tlie boy “a pretty girl” or vice 
versa. This, too, should be avoided, for the reasons 
which we discuss in the chapter on adolescence. 

The general environment of the family is nat- 
urally important because it gives the children an 


 
indication of the extent to which the family takes 
part in social life. It gives them^ in other words^ 
the first impressions about co-operation. Children 
who grow up in an isolated family draw a sharp 
line between members of the family and outside 
persons. They feel as if there is a chasm separating 
the home and the outside world, which of course 
they regard in a hostile light. An isolated family 
life does not promote social relations and it in- 
clines the children to be always suspicious and 
to look out only for their own interests. In this 
way it handicaps the development of social-minded- 
ness. 

A child at the age of three should be already pre- 
pared to join with other children in games and 
should not be scared by the presence of strangers. 
Otherwise the child will later turn out to be bash- 
ful and self-conscious, and will take a hostile at- 
titude to others. Generally this trait is to be found 
among pampered children. Such children always 
want to ‘‘exclude” others. 

If a parent occupies himself early with the cor- 
rection of such traits he can be sure that the child 
will be spared a great deal of trouble later on. If a 
child has had a good up-bringing in his first three 
or four years— -if he has been trained to play with 


 
others and to join in the common spirit — ^he will be 
spared not only bashfulness and egotism, but also 
a possible neurosis and even insanity. Insanity and 
neuroses occur only in the case of persons who live 
ill an isolated manner, who are not interested in 
others, and who have not the right knack for co- 
operation. 

While we are on the subject of family environ- 
ment, we may mention the difficulties which arise 
as a result of a change of economic circumstances. 
If a family had once been rich, particularly when 
the child was very young, and then lost its money, 
there is obviously a difficult situation. Such a situa- 
tion is hardest on a pampered child, for he is not 
prepared for circumstances under which he cannot 
get as much attention as before. He misses his past 
advantages and repines over them. 

If a family suddenly becomes rich, there are 
again difficulties in the bringing up of the children. 
Here tke parents are not prepared for the proper 
use of their wealth, a^d they especially make mis- 
takes in regard to the children. They want to give 
the children a good time, they want to pamper 
them and spoil them because they feel they now 
need not stint on anything. As a result we find 
problem children very often among families that 



 
are newly rich. The son of a newly rich father is a 
notorious instance of this type of problem chiHo 

Such difficulties and even disasters can he 
avoided if the child is properly trained in Co-’ 
operation. All these situations are like open doors 
through which a child escapes the necessary traiii“ 
ing in co-operation, and we must be specially on the 
watch on that account. 

Not only are children influenced by abnormali- 
ties in material circumstances, as poverty and sud- 
den riches, hut they are also influenced by abnor- 
malities in psychological circumstances. We have 
in mind psychological prejudices which arise out 
of the family situation. These prejudices may arise 
out of personal acts, as, for example, if the father 
or mother has done something that is socially dis- 
graceful. In that case the child’s mind will be 
greatly affected. The child will face the future in 
fear and trepidation. He will want to hide himself 
from his fellows and will he afraid of being dis- 
covered to be the child of such a parent. 

The parents have a responsibility not oiily to 
provide an education in reading, writing and arith- 
metic for their child, but also to give him the proper 
psychological basis of development so that he %vill 


 


not liave to bear greater difficulties than others. 

Thus, if a father is a drunkard, or if lie is higli- 
tempered, he must remember that it all affects the 
child. If the marriage is an unhappy one, if the 
husband and wife constantly quarrel, it is the child 
who again pays. 

These childhood experiences are like living in- 
scriptions in the soul of the child, and he cannot 
forget them very easily. He can, of course, obviate 
their effects if he has been trained in co-operation. 

But the very situations which create these trials 
for the child prevent him from getting that train- 
ing from the parents. That is why there has been in 
recent years a concerted movement to organize 
child guidance clinics in the schools. If the parent, 
for one reason or another, falls down on his task, 
liis work must be taken over b}^ a psychologically- 
trained teacher, who can guide the child to a 
healthy life. 

Besides the prejudices which arise from per- 
sonal circumstances there are the prejudices due j 

to nationality, race and religion. One will always 
find that such prejudices affect not merely the child 
who is humiliated, but also the others, the aggres- 
sive ones who do the humiliating. They become ar- 
rogant and conceited ; they believe that they belong 


 
to a privileged group, and when they try to live up 
to the privilege which they have erected for them- 
selves, they end up as failures. 

The prejudices between nations and races are of 
course the basic causes of war^ — ^that great scourge 
of mankind which must be abolished if progress 
and culture are to be saved. The task for the 
teacher is to show war in its true light, and not to 
give the child an easy and cheap opportunity of ex- 
pressing liis superiority striving by playing with 
gains and swords. This is not the proper prepara- 
tion for a cultured life. There are many boys who 
join the army as a result of the military education 
of childhood; but besides those that join the army 
there are a hundred times as many who are psycho- 
logically crippled for the rest of their life by their 
childhood warrior games. They always go through 
life like warriors — ^with chips on their shoulders — 
and they never learn the art of getting along with 
their fellow men. 

Ai’ound Christmas time and other seasons for 
toys, parents should especially keep an eye on the 
type of toys and games that are put into the chil- 
dren’s hands. They should get rid of weapons and 
war games, as well as of all the books that worship 
war heroes and deeds of fighting. 




 

As regards tlie selection of proper toys, a great 
deal could be said, but the principle is that we 
should select the type of toys that will stimulate 
the child to be co-operative and constructive in liis 
occupations. One can well understand that games 
in which a child can work and build up things are 
more worth while than ready-made or finished toys, 
which require the child merely to fondle a doll or 
an imitation dog, etc. Incidentally, as regards an- 
imals, children should be instructed to regard an 
animal not as toy or a game, but as a comrade of 
human beings. He should not be afraid of animals 
nor should he boss them or be cruel to them. When- 
ever children exhibit cruelty to animals one may 
suspect in them a desire to dominate and bully per- 
sons weaker than themselves. If there are animals, 
— birds, dogs, and cats — in the house, the children 
should be taught to regard them as living beings 
who feel and have pain in a way similar to human 
beings. Proper comradeship with animals may be 
regarded as a preparatory stage for social co- 
operation with human beings. 

In the environment of children there are always 
relatives. First of all are the grandparents, and we 
have to consider their plight and situation in a dis- 



 
to a privileged group, and when they try to live up 
to the privilege which they have erected for them- 
selves, they end up as failures.

In the environment of children there are always 
relatives. First of all are the grandparents, and we 
have to consider their plight and situation in a dis- 



THE EDUCATION OF CHILBEEN 
interested manner. The position of grandparents 
is sometliing of a tragedy in our culture. \YIieii 
people grow up, they should have room to expand, 
they should have more occupations and interests. 
But just the reverse happens in our society. Old 
people feel put back, so to speak, relegated to a 
comer. It is a pity because such persons could ac- 
complish much more and could be infinitely hap- 
pier if they had more of an opportunity foi’ work- 
ing and striving. One should never advise a man 
at the age of 60, 70 or even 80 to retire from his 
business. It is much easier to continue in business 
than to change one’s whole scheme of life. But ow- 
ing to our mistaken social customs we put old peo- 
ple on the shelf while they are still full of activity. 
We give them no opportunity for continued self- 
expression. As a result, what happens ? The mis- 
takes that we visit on the grandparents rebound on 
the children. The grandparents are always in the 
position of having to prove — what they should not 
have to prove — ^that they are still alive and count 
in the world. In trying to prove this they are al- 
ways interfering with the education of the grand- 
children. They pamper the children terribly. It is 
a disastrous way of attempting to prove that they 
still, know how to bring up children. 



 
We sliould avoid hurting the feelings of these 
good and kind old people. But while they should be 
given an opportunity for more activity, they should 
be taught that children should grow up as inde- 
pendent human beings and should not be the play- 
things of other persons. They should not be 
exploited according to the exigencies of family poli- 
tics. If the old people have arguments with the 
parents, let them win or lose the arguments but not 
try to put the children on their side. 

How often do we find, when we study the bio- 
graphies of psychological patients, that they were 
the favorites of their grandmothers or grand- 
fathers! We immediately understand how this con- 
tributed to their childhood difficulties. Either their 
favoritism meant pampering or it meant stirring 
up rivalries and jealousies in reference to the other 
children. Also many children say to themselves, ‘T 
was the favorite of my grandfather,” and feel hurt 
if they are not the favorite of other persons. 

Among the other relatives who play a great role 
are the “brilliant cousins.” They may be set down 
as a great nuisance. Sometimes they are not only 
brilliant but are also beautiful, and we can readily 
see what trouble it creates for a child to be re- 
minded that he has a brilliant or beautiful cousin. 




 
If he is courageous and social-minded he will un- 
derstand that to be bright means simply to train 
better, and be will look for a way of overtaking the 
brilliant cousin. But if he believes, as most often 
happens, that brilliance is a blessing from nature — 
that people are bom brilliant — ^then lie will feel 
inferior and badly treated by fate. In this way liis 
whole development will be retarded. As for beauty, 
which is to be sure a gift of nature but one that is 
constantly overvalued in our civilization, we can 
also see the mistakes in a child’s style of life which 
are likely to arise when the child smarts under the 
painful thought that he or she has a beautiful 
cousin. Even after twenty years people still feel 
keenly the childhood envy of a beautiful cousin. 

The only way to combat the ravages of this cult 
of beauty is to teach children that healtli and the 
ability to get along mth one’s fellow beings are 
more important than beauty. There is no gainsay- 
ing the fact that beauty is of value, and that it is 
more desirable to have a beautiful race of persons 
than an ugly race. But in any rational planning of 
things one value cannot be isolated from the rest 
and held up as the supreme goal. This is what hap- 
pens with beauty. That beauty is not sufficient for 
a rational and good life is evidenced by the fact 


 
that we find among criminal types some very liand- 
some boySj as well as others that are quite ugly. 
We can understand how these handsome boys may 
have become criminals. They knew they were hand- 
some and they thought everything would come 
their way. They were, therefore, not prepared 
properly for life. Later on, however, they found 
they could not solve their problems without effort, 
and so they took the road of least resistance. As the 
poet Virgil said, ^Jacilis descensus Averm /" — the 
descent to hell is easy. . . . 

A word should be said about reading matter for 
children. What kinds of books should be given to 
children? What should be done with fairy tales? 
How should a book like the Bible be read to them? 
The main point here is that we generally overlook 
the fact that a child understands things in a wholly 
different way from an adult. We also overlook the 
fact that each child grasps things along the line of 
his own particular type of interest. If he is a timid 
child he will find in the Bible and in fairy tales 
stories that approve his timidity and make him al- 
ways dread dangers. Fairy tales and Bible pas- 
sages always need to be commented upon and 
interpreted so that the child gets the meaning that 


 
is intended and not the one that his subjective 
fancy dictates. 

Fairy tales are of course enjoyable reading — 
even adults can read them with profit. But there is 
one point that needs to be corrected about them, 
and that is the sense of remoteness from particular 
times and places. Children seldom understand the 
differences of ages and the differences of cultures. 
They read a fairy tale which has been written in a 
totally different age and they do not make allow- 
ance for the difference in outlook. There is always 
the jj^’ince, and the prince is always praised and 
decorated, and his whole character is presented in 
a very alluring fashion. The circumstances de- 
scribed of course never existed, but they represent 
the fictional idealization proper to a certain period 
when it was necessary to worship the prince. Chil- 
dren should be told about such things. They should 
be told about the make-believe which is behind the 
magic; otherwise they may grow up always look- 
ing for an easy way out of ^ things, like a certain 
boy of twelve, who, when asked what he wanted to 
be, said, “I want to be a magician.” 

Fairy tales, when properly commentated, can 
be used as a vehicle for instilling in children the 
sense of co-operation as well as for enlarging their 


 
outlook. As regards motion pictures, it may be said 
that there is no danger in taking a child of a year 
to see a film, but cliildren of a later age will al- 
ways misunderstand the pictures. Even fairy tale 
plays are often misunderstood by them. Thus a 
child at the age of four saw a certain fairy tale per- 
formed in a theatre. Years later he still believed 
that there were women in the world v/lio sell poi- 
soned apples. Many children do not understand 
the theme rightly, or else they make sweeping gen- 
eralizations. It is up to the parent to explain things 
until he is sure they have imderstood rightly. 

The reading of newspapers is one outside influ- 
ence that can well be spared children. Newspapers 
are written for adults and do not have the child’s 
point of view. There are in certain places special 
children’s newspapers, and these are ail to the good. 
But as for the ordinary newspaper, it gives a dis- 
torted picture of life to the unprepared child. The 
child gets to believe that our whole life is full of 
murders, crimes and « accidents. Accident reports 
are specially depressing to young children. We can 
gather from remarks of grown up persons how 
much they were afraid of fire during childhood, 
and how this fear has continued to obsess their 
minds. 




 
These examples comprise only a small selection 
of the outside influences which the parent and edu- 
cator have to consider in . 
They are, however, the most important, and they 
illustrate the general principles involved. Again 
and again the Individual Psychologist has to in- 
sist upon the watchwords, “Social Interest” and 
“Courage.” Here, as in other problems, the same 
slogans hold good.
