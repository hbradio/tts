CHAPTER TWEEYE 


ADOLESCENCE AND SEX EDUCATION 

W HOLE libraries have been written about 
adolescence. The topic is indeed an im- 
portant one, but not altogether in the way people 
imagine it. Adolescents are not all alike: we find 
all varieties of children in that class* — striving chil- 
dren, clumsy children, children that are neatly 
dressed, children that go around very dirty, etc. 
We also find grown up persons and even old peo- 
ple who look and act like adolescents. From the 
point of view of Individual Psychology this is not 
very surprising, and it means simply that these 
grown up persons have stopped at a certain stage 
of development. In fact adolescence is, for Individ- 
ual Psychology, simply a stage of development 
through which all individuals must pass. We do not 
believe that any stage of development, or any sit- 
uation, can change a person. But it does act as a 
test — as a new situation^ which brings out the char- 
acter traits developed in the past. 




THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 

Take, for example, a cliildliood in wliicli the 
child lias been closety watched and observed, a 
cliildhoocl in which the child has not enjoyed much 
power and has not been able to express wliat lie 
wants. In the stage of adolescence, where there is 
a rapid biological and psychological development, 
such a child will act as if he has lost his chains. He 
will go ahead quickly and his personality will de- 
velop along sound lines. On the other hand there 
mil be other children who will begin to stop and 
look back, and by looking back towards the past 
they will fail to find the right way in the present. 
TIie.y are not interested in life, and become very 
reserved. It is a sign, in their case, not of energies 
held in leash in a repressed childhood and finding 
their release in adolescence, but rather of a pam- 
pered childhood which has deprived them of the 
proper preparation for life. 

In adolescence we are able to read a person’s style 
of life better than ever before. The reason is, of 
course, that adolescence is nearer the front of life 
than is childhood. We can now see better how he will 
behave towards science. We can see whether he can 
make friends easily, whether he can be a fellowman 
who is socially interested in others. 



THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 

Sometimes tills social interests so far from being 
absents takes on an exaggerated expressions and we 
meet witli adolescents who have lost the sense of 
balance and want only to sacrifice their lives for 
others. They are over-ad jnsted socially, and this, 
too, may prove an obstacle to their development. 
We know that if a person really wants to be in- 
terested in others and work for the cominon cause, 
he must first take care of himself. He must have 
something to give of himself, if the giving is to mean 
anything. 

On the other side, we see many youths in the 
period between fourteen and twenty who feel alto- 
gether lost socially. At fourteen they have left school 
and have thus lost touch with all their old com- 
rades ; and it will take them a long time to form new 
ties. In the meantime they feel wholly isolated. 

Then there is the question of occupation. Here 
again adolescence is revealing. It will reveal the at- 
titude formed in the style of life. We will find some 
youths becoming very independent and working 
marvelously. They will show that they are on the 
proper road to development. Others, however, will 
come to a stop in this period. They will not find the 
right occupation for themselves; they will always be 


 
changing — either changing trades or changing 
schools, etc. Or else they will be idle and will not 
want to work at all. 

None of tliese symptoms is created in adolescence, 
blit they are merely brought more clearly to the 
surface in this period — ^they have been prepared be- 
fore, iind if a person really knows a particular child, 
he can predict how he will behave in the period of 
adolescence when he is given opportunities to ex- 
press himself more independently than in the period 
when he was watched, guarded and restricted. 

We turn to the third fundamental problem of 
life — love and marriage. What does the adolescent’s 
answer to this problem reveal about his personality? 
Again there is no break with the pre-adolescent 
period, only a heightened psychological activity 
which makes the answers more clear-cut than be- 
fore. We will find that some adolescents are wholly 
sure as to how they have to behave. They are either 
romantic on the problem of love or are very cou- 
rageous. In any case they find the right norm of be- 
havior towards the other sex. 

There is another group at the other extreme, wlio 
become terribly shy on the question of sex. Now 
that they are much nearer the front, so to speak, 
they show up their lack of preparation. The indica- 



 


tions about personality that we derive from the 
period of adolescence make possible a reliable judg- 
ment as to the course of behavior in later life. We 
Imow what must be done if we want to change the 

future. 

If an adolescent shows himself very negativistic 
in regard to the other sex, we will find, if we trace 
back his life, that he was probably a fighting child. 
Perhaps he was one that felt depressed because an- 
other child was preferred. As a result he believes 
now that he must step forward very strongly, that 
he must be arrogant and deny all the calls of senti- 
ment. His attitude to sex is thus a reflex of his child- 
hood experiences. 

In the period of adolescence we often find the de- 
sire to leave home. This may be due to the fact that 
the child has never been satisfied with home condi- 
tions, and is now aching for the first opportunity to 
break home ties. He does not want to be supported 
any more, although it is really for the best interests 
of both the child and the parent that the support be 
continued. Otherwise, in case things go wrong with 
the child, the lack of help from the parents becomes 
an alibi for his failure. 

The same tendency, expressed in a smaller de- 
gree, is found in the case of children who remain at 



 
liome, but use every possible occasion to sta}?' out at 
oiglit. It is, of course, mucli more alluring to go out 
at night and seek amusement than to stay quietly at 
home. It is also an implicit accusation against the 
home, and a sign that at home the child does not feel 
free, but is always guarded and watched. Thus lie 
has never had the occasion to express himself and to 
find out his own mistakes. The period of adolescence 
is a dangerous time to make a beginning in this direc- 
tion. 

Many children also feel a sudden loss of apprecia- 
tion more keenly in the period of adolescence than 
they would have felt before. Perhaps they had been 
good pupils at school and highly appreciated by 
their teachers; then they were suddenly transferred 
to a new school, to a new social environment or to a 
new occupation. And then, too, we know that often 
the best pupils at school do not continue to be the 
best in the period of adolescence. They seem to un- 
dergo a change, but in reality there is no change, 
only that the old situation did not show up their 
character as truly as the new situation. 

From all this, it follows that one of the best pre- 
ventives for the troubles of adolescence is the culti- 
vation of friendship. Children should be good friends 
and comrades with one another. And this goes for 


 
inenibers of the family as well as for people outside 
the family. The family should be a unit in which 
every one trusts the others. The child should trust 
his parents and his teachers. Indeed, in the period 
of adolescence only that type of parent and teacher 
can continue in his capacity of guide to the child who 
has hitherto been a comrade and sympathetic fellow- 
man to his charge. Any other kind of parent or 
teacher is immediately shut out by the child during 
tills period; the child will not repose any confidences 
in him and will regard him as a complete outsider or 
even as an enemy. 

Among girls, one will find that it is just at this 
time that they will reveal their dislike of the feminine 
role, and that they will seek to imitate boys. It is of 
course much easier to imitate boys in the adolescent 
vices — ^that is, in smoking, drinking and joining 
gangs — ^than in the virtues of hard work. Also, the 
girls have the excuse that if they did not copy such 
practices the boys would not be interested in them. 

If we analyze this masculine protest of the ado- 
lescent girl we shall find that the girl in question 
never liked the feminine role from early childhood. 
Hitherto, however, her dislike was covered up, and 
it comes out clearly only in adolescence. That is 
why it is so important to observe the behavior of 



 
girls at this time, for it is then that we can find out 
how they stand in regard to their sex role of the fu- 
ture. 

Boys at this age often like to play the role of a 
man who is very wise, very brave and self-confident. 
Another class is afraid of their problems, and do 
not trust themselves to be really and completely 
men. If there has been any defect in their education 
for the male role this is the time it will come out. 
They will show themselves effeminate, they will like 
to behave like girls, and they will even imitate the 
vices of girls — ^being coquettish, liking to pose, etc. 

Parallel with this feminine extreme among boys, 
we may also find boys who excel in the typically boy- 
ish traits, which may be carried to the extreme of 
vice. They will excel in drinking and in sexual ex- 
cesses. Sometimes they will even begin to commit 
crimes merely out of a desire to show off their manli- 
ness. Such vices are found among boys who want to 
be superior, who want to be leaders and who want 
to astonish their comrades. , 

In this type, however, despite the bravado and 
ambition, there is often a secret trait of cowardice. 
We have had recently some notorious examples of 
this in America — ^types like Hickman, Leopold and 
Loeb. If we examine such careers we shall find that 



 

they were prepared for an easy life and were always 
looking for easy successes. Such types are active but 
not courageous— just the right combination for 
criminality. 

We often find children at the adolescent age strik- 
ing their parents for the first time. One who does 
not look for the hidden unity behind their actions 
will imagine that these children have suddenly 
changed. But, if we study what happened before, 
we realize that the individual is quite the same in 
character, only that he now has more power and 
more possibilities for action. 

Another point to he considered is that in the period 
of adolescence every child feels that he is con- 
fronted with a test — ^he feels that he must prove that 
he is no longer a child. This is of course a very 
treacherous feeling, for every time we feel that we 
must prove something, we are likely to go too far. 
And so the child also goes too far. 

This is indeed the most significant symptom of 
adolescence. And the way to counteract it is by ex- 
plaining to the youth that he does not have to con- 
vince us that he is no longer a child; we do not need 
the proof .By telling him this we may avoid the exag- 
gerated features we have mentioned. 

Among girls we often find a type that is inclined 


THE EDUCATION OP CHILDREN 
to exaggerate sex relations and become “boy-crazy.” 
These girls are always fighting with their mothers 
and always believe themselves to be suppressed (and 
perhaps they are really suppressed) ; they will have 
relations with any man they meet in order to spite 
the mother. They are quite happy in the knowledge 
that the mother will be pained if she should find out. 
Many an adolescent girl has had first sex relations 
with a man after running out of the house on account 
of a quarrel with the mother, or because the father 
was too severe. 

It is ironical to think of girls being suppressed by 
tbeir parents in order that they may be good girls, 
and then turning out bad because of the parents’ 
lack of psychological insight. The fault in such cases 
does not lie with the girls but with the parents, be- 
cause they have not properly prepared the girls for 
the situations they must meet. They have sheltered 
the girls too much before adolescence, and as a re- 
sult they have failed to develop in them the judg- 
ment and self-reliance necqssary for meeting the 
pitfalls of adolescence. 

Sometimes the difficulties appear not in adoles- 
cence but after adolescence, in marriage. The prin- 
ciple is, however, the same. It is simply that the girls 
were fortunate enough not to meet an unfavorable 


 
situation in adolescence. But sooner or later an un- 
favorable situation is bound to occur, and it is neces- 
sary to be prepared for it. 

A single case history may be cited here to illus» 
trate concretely the problem of the adolescent girl. 
The girl in this case was fifteen years old and came 
from, a very poor family. Unfortunately she had an 
older brother who was always sick and had to be 
nursed by the mother. The girl noticed the differ- 
ence in attention from her early childhood. What 
complicated matters was the fact that when she was 
born the father was also sick, and the mother had to 
take care of both him and the brother. The girl had 
a double example of what it means to he nursed and 
to get attention, and it became her passionate long- 
ing to he cared for and to be appreciated by people. 
She could not find this appreciation in the family 
circle, especially as a younger sister was soon horn 
into the family and deprived her of the little modi- 
cum of attention that she still had. ISTow as fate 
would have it, when the younger sister was born the 
father got well, so that the baby got more attention 
than she herself had received during her infancy. 
Children notice these things. 

The girl made up for her lack of attention at home 
by striving hard at school. She made herself the best 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDKEN 
pupil in her class, and because she was such a good 
pupil it was proposed that she continue her studies 
and go through high school. But as she entered high 
school a change took place. Her studies were not so 
good, and the reason was that her new teacher did 
not know her and did not appreciate her. She, on her 
side, was eager for appreciation, but now she lacked 
it both at home and at school. She had to get her ap- 
preciation somewhere. And so she went out to look 
for a man who would appreciate her. She lived with 
the man for a fortnight. Then the man got tired of 
her. We could have predicted what would happen; 
we could have predicted that she would realize that 
this is not the appreciation she wanted. In the mean- 
time the family became worried and started a search 
for her. Suddenly they received a letter from her, 
saying, ‘T have taken poison. Do not worry — ■ I am 
happy.” Suicide was obviously her next thought, 
after being defeated in her quest for happiness and 
appreciation. Nonetheless she did not commit sui- 
cide ; she used suicide as a scare with which to bring 
about forgiveness from her parents. She continued 
to run around the streets until her mother found her 
and brought her home. 

If the girl knew, as we know, that her whole life 
was dominated by the striving to be appreciated, 



 
then all these things would not have happened. Also 
if the teacher at the high school had realized that the 
girl had always been good in her studies and that all 
she needed was a certain measure of appreciation^ 
the tragedy would again not have taken place. At 
any point in the chain of circumstances a proper 
handling of the girl could have prevented her going 
to ruin. 

This brings up the matter of sex education. The 
subject of sex education has been frightfully exag- 
gerated in recent times. There are many persons 
who are, if we may say so, insane on the subject of 
sex education. They want sex education at any and 
all ages, and they play up the dangers of sexual 
ignorance. But if we look into our own past and 
into the past of others we do not see such great dif- 
ficulties nor such great dangers as they imagine. 

What the experience of Individual Psychology 
teaches is that a child should be told at the age of two 
that he is a boy or a girl. It should also be explained 
to him at that time that his sex can never be changed, 
and that boys grow up to be men and girls grow up 
to be women. If this is done, then the lack of other 
knowledge is not so dangerous. If it is brought home 
to him that a girl will not be educated like a boy nor 
a boy like a girl, then the sex role will be fixed in 



 
his mind and lie will be sure to develop and to pre- 
pare for Ms role in a normal manner. If he believes^ 
however, that through a certain trick lie can change 
Ills sex, then trouble will result. Trouble will also 
result if the parents are always expressing a desire 
to change the sex of a child. In The JV ell of Lone- 
liness we find an excellent literary presentation of 
this situation. Parents too often like to educate a 
girl like a hoy or vice versa. They will photograph 
their children dressed in the clothes of the opposite 
sex. It sometimes happens, too, that a girl looks 
like a boy, and then people in the environment begin 
calling the child by its wrong sex. This may start a 
great confusion, which can very well be avoided. 

There should also be avoided any discussion about 
the sexes which tends to undervalue the female sex, 
and to regard hoys as superior. Children should be 
made to understand that both sexes are of equal 
worth. This is important not merely in order to pre- 
vent an inferiority complex on the part of the mem- 
bers of the undervalued sex,' but also to prevent a 
bad effect upon the children of the male sex. If 
boys were not taught to think that they are the supe- 
rior sex, they would not look upon girls as mere ob- 
jects of desire. Nor would they look upon the rela- 


 
tioas of the sexes 121 an ugly light if they knew their 
fiitare tasks, 

is not merely explaining to children the physiology 
of sexual relationships — ^it inyolves the proper prep- 
aration of the whole attitude towards love and mar- 
riage, This is closely related to the question of social 
adjustment. If a person is not socially adjusted he 
will make a joke out of the question of sex and look 
at things entirely from the point of view of self- 
indulgence. This happens of course all too often, 
and is a reflex of the defects of our culture. Women 
have to suffer because under our culture it is much 
easier for a man to play the leading role. But the 
man also suffers because by means of this fictitious 
superiority he loses touch with the underlying 
values. 

As regards the physical phase of sex education, it 
is not necessary that children receive this education 
very early in life. One can wait until the child be- 
comes curious, until he wants to find out certain 
things. A mother and father who are interested in 
the child will also know when it is proper for them 
to take the lead if the child is too shy to ask ques- 
tions. If he feels that his father and mother are com- 


 
rades he will ask questions, and then the answers 
must be given in a manner proper to his understand- 
ing. One most avoid giving answers that stimulate 
the sex drive. 

Ill this connection it may be said that one need 
not always be alarmed by apparently premature 
manifestations of the sex instinct. Sex development 
begins very early, in fact in the first weeks of life. It 
is v/holly certain that an infant experiences ero- 
genous pleasures, and that he sometimes seeks to 
stimulate the erogenous zones artificially. We should 
not be frightened if we see signs of the beginnings 
of certain nuisances, but we should do our best to put 
a stop to these practices without seeming to attach 
too much importance to them. If a child finds out 
that we are worried over these matters he will con- 
tinue his habits deliberately in order to gain atten- 
tion. It is such actions that make us think he is a 
victim of the sex drive, when he is really exploiting 
a habit as a tool for showing off. Generally little 
children try to gain attention- by playing with their 
genital organs because they know that their parents 
are afraid of this practice. It is much the same psy- 
chology as when children play sick because they have 
noticed that when they are sick they are more pam- 
pered and more appreciated. 




THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 

Children should not be stimulated bodily by too 
. much kissing and embracing. It is cruel to the child, 
especially in the adolescent period. Nor should chil- 
dren be stimulated mentally on the subject of sex. 
It happens very often that a child will discover some 
frivolous pictures in the father’s library. We hear 
constantly of such cases in the psychological clinics. 
The children should not be able to put their hands 
on books which deal with sexual matters on a plane 
above their age. Nor should they be taken to see 
moving picture shows in which the sex theme is ex- 
ploited. 

If one avoids all such forms of premature stimula- 
tion, one need not have any fears. One needs only 
to speak at the right time in a few simple words, 
never irritating the child and always giving answers 
in a true and simple manner. Above all one must 
never lie to the child, if one wants to retain his trust. 
If the child trusts the parent he will discount the ex- 
planations that he hears from his comrades — ^per- 
haps ninety per cent»of mankind get their sexual 
knowledge from comrades — and will believe what 
the parent says. Such co-operation, such camaraderie 
is much more important than the various subter- 
fuges that are used in the belief that they answer 
the situation. 




THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 

Cliildren who experience too miicli of sex, or ex- 
perience sex too early in life, general!}^ shrink from 
sex later on. That is why it is a good thing to avoid 
having the children notice the love-making of par- 
ents. If possible they should not sleep in the same 
room — and certainly not in the same bed — with the 
parents. Also, sisters, and brothers should not sleep 
in the same room. The parents must keep an eye 
open to see that the children behave rightly, and 
they should also be on the watch for outside in- 
fluences. 

These remarks sum up the most important items 
in the matter of sex education. We see here, as in 
all other phases of education, the dominant impor- 
tance of the sense of co-operation and friendliness 
within the family. With this co-operation present, 
and with an early knowledge of the sex role and of 
the equality of man and woman, the child is well 
prepared against any dangers that he may meet. 
And above ail, he is well prepared for carrying on 
his work in a healthy manner.'
