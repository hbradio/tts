CHAPTER TWO 


THE UNITY OF PERSONALITY 

T he psyeliic life of a child is a wonderful thing, 
and it fascinates at every point where one 
touches it. Perhaps the most remarkable fact of all 
is the in which one must unroll the whole scroll 
of the child’s life in order to understand a single 
event. Every act seems to express the whole of a 
child’s life and personality, and is thus unintelli- 
gible without a knowledge of this invisible back- 
ground. To this phenomenon we give the name unity 
of personality. 

The development of this unity — ^the co-ordination 
of actions and expressions into a single pattern — 
begins at a very early age. The demands of life com- 
pel the child to make his responses in a unified man- 
ner, and this unified manner of answering situations 
is not only what constitutes the child’s character but 
individualizes each of his acts and makes them dis- 
tinct from the similar acts of other children. 

This fact of the unity of personality is generally 


,  
overlooked by most schools of psychology; or, if it 
is not entirely overlooked, it does not receive in their 
hands the attention that it deserves. As a result we 
often find both in psychological theory and in psy- 
chiatrical technique a particular gesture or a par- 
ticular expression singled out for consideration as if 
it were an independent entity. Sometimes such a 
manifestation is called a complex, and the assump- 
tion is that it is possible to separate it from the rest 
of an individual’s activity. But such a procedure is 
comparable to singling out one note from an entire 
melody and attempting to understand the signif- 
icance of this one note apart from the string of notes 
which make up the melody. The procedure is an ini“ 
proper one, but unfortunately it is widespread. 

Individual Psychology is compelled to take a 
stand against this widespread error, which is espe- 
cially harmful when it is applied to the education of 
children. In that connection it expresses itself in the 
theory of punishment. What happens generally 
when a child does something that invites pun- 
ishment? It is true that in a certain sense the total 
impression made by the child’s personality is usually 
taken into account, but this is more often a disad- 
vantage than otherwise, since in the case of an oft- 
repeated mistake the teacher or parent is apt to be 


THE EDUCATION OE CHILDREN 
prejudiced in approaching the child and regards him 
as incorrigible. It is also true that on the basis of a 
total impression one is apt to deal less harshly with 
the mistakes of a child whose behavior is otherwise 
quite good. Nonetheless in neither instance do we 
reach the real root of the problem as we should on the 
basis of the total comprehension of the child’s unity 
of personality. We are in the position of trying to 
understand the significance of a few individual notes 
torn from the context of the whole melody. 

When we ask a child why he is lazy, we cannot 
expect him to know the basic connection which it is 
essential for us to know. Neither can we expect him 
to tell us why he lies. For thousands of years the say- 
ing of Socrates, who had so great an understanding 
of human nature, has been sounding in our ears: 
“How difficult it is to know one’s self!” By what 
right, then, can we demand that a child answer such 
complex questions, the solution of which is difficult 
even for a psychologist? To be able to understand 
the significance of individual expression presup- 
poses having a method for understanding the whole 
personality. This does not mean a description of 
what he does and how he acts, but involves under- 
standing the child’s attitude towards the tasks which 
lie before him. 




 

The following example shows how essential it is 
that we understand the whole context of a child’s 
life. A boy of thirteen was the older of two children. 
He was for five years the only child of parents who 
had seen better days. Then a sister was born. Pre- 
viously every person in his environment was only too 
glad to fulfill every desire the boy had. The mother 
undoubtedly pampered him. The father was a good- 
natured, tranquil sort of person, who enjoyed his 
son’s dependence on him. The son, naturally, was 
closer to his mother, since the father 'was an army 
officer and frequently away from home. N'ow the 
mother was a clever and well-meaning woman, who 
tried to satisfy every whim of her dependent but in- 
sistent son. Nonetheless she was often annoyed at a 
display of ill-breeding or threatening gestures. A 
state of tension was created, and this tension ex- 
pressed itself chiefly in the boy’s constantly trying 
to tyrannize his mother — ordering her about, teas- 
ing her, and in short making himself disagreeably 
prominent wherever and whenever he could. 

The boy’s conduct was very troublesome to his 
mother, hut since there w^ere no other particularly 
bad features, she yielded to him, kept his clothes in 
order and helped him with his school work. The boy 
was always confident that his mother would help him 


 
out of any difficulty he got into. He was undoubt- 
edly an inteUigent child, just as well educated as 
the average, and he went through elementary school 
with fair success until his eighth year. At that time 
a great transformation took place which made the 
relation of the child to his parents unendurable. INot 
only did he drive liis mother wild by his complete 
neglect of himself and by personal carelessness in 
connection with all bodily functions, but he would 
pull his mother’s hair whenever she did not give him 
what he wanted ; he never left her in peace, always 
pinching her ear or pulling her hand. He refused to 
abandon his tactics, and as his baby sister grew up, 
he clung all the more to the behavior pattern he had 
devised. His little sister soon became the target of 
his tricks. Not that he went so far as to harm the 
child physically, but his jealousy of her was clearly 
apparent. His great deterioration dates from the 
time his sister was born and began to play a role in 
the family constellation. 

It needs to be particularly emphasized that in such 
a situation, when a child’s behavior grows worse, or 
certain new unpleasant symptoms make their ap- 
pearance, we must take into consideration not only 
the time when the condition started hut also the 
stimulating cause. The word cause must be used re- 


 
liictantlys since one cannot see wliy the birth of a 
sister sliouM be a reason for an older brother’s be- 
comirig a problem child. Nonetheless this happens 
frequently, and this relationship cannot be regarded 
other than as a mistaken attitude on the part of the 
child. It is not a matter of causality in the strict 
physical-scientific sense, for it cannot be claimed 
that because a younger child is born the older one 
must deteriorate. It may be asserted that when a 
stone falls to the ground, it must fall in a certain 
direction and with a certain speed. But the investiga- 
tions made by Individual Psychology give it the 
right to claim that in a psychic “fall” strict causality 
does not play a role — only bigger or smaller mis- 
takes which, after they are made, affect the future 
development of the individual. 

It is no cause for wonder that in the development 
of the human psyche mistakes should appear, and 
that these mistakes and their consequences should 
Ke side by side and reveal themselves in some failure 
or wrong orientation. All this is due to the goal- 
setting activity of the psyche, and this goal-setting 
involves judgment — ^that is to say, the possibility 
of maldng mistakes. This setting or determining of 
a goal commences in the earliest years. In his second 
or tliird year, as a rule, the child begins to fix for 


 
himself a goal of superiority which is forever before 
him and towards which he strives in his own man- 
nero Now the fixing of the goal usually involves in- 
correct judgment ; nonetheless it is more or less bind- 
ing on the child. The child concretizes his goal, in 
his specific acts and arranges his entire life, so that 
it becomes a constant striving towards this goal. 

We see, then, how important it is to bear in mind 
that a child’s development is determined by his per- 
sonal, individual interpretation of things; how im- 
portant to realize that the child always behaves in 
the circle of his personal mistakes whenever he ap- 
proaches a new and difficult situation. We know 
that the depth or character of the impression which 
the situation makes upon the child does not depend 
upon the objective fact or circumstance (as for ex- 
ample the birth of a second child), but depends 
rather on how this child regards the fact. This is suf- 
ficient ground for refuting the theory of causality; 
necessary connection exists between objective facts 
and their absolute meaning, but not between mis- 
taken views of facts. 

What is truly remarkable about our psychic life 
is that it is our points of view which decide the di- 
rections we take, and not the facts themselves. This 
is an extraordinarily important circumstance, inas- 


 
much as all our actmties are regulated and our per- 
soiiality is organized on the basis of it. A classic ex“ 
ample of this play of subjective ideas in human ac- 
tion is fui-nished by Cesar’s landing in Egypt. As 
he jumped ashore he stumbled and fell on the 
gi’oiind, and the Roman soldiers took this as an un- 
favorable omen. Brave as they were, they would 
nonetheless have turned around and gone hack, had 
not Csesar thrown out his arms and cried out, “I 
have you, Africa!’* We can see from this how little 
the structure of reality is causal, and how its effects 
can be moulded and determined by an organized and 
well-integrated personality. The same thing holds 
true with regard to mob psychology and its rela- 
tions to reason: if a condition of mob psychology 
gives way to common sense, it is not because either 
the mob psychology or common sense reason were 
causally determined by the situation, but because 
both represent spontaneous points of view. Usually 
common sense does not make its appearance until 
after mistaken points of view have been tried out. 

Coming back to the story of the boy, we may say 
that he soon found himself in a difficult situation. 
No one liked him any more, he made no progress at 
school and yet he continued to behave in the same 
way. His behavior, which was continually disturbing 


 
to otlierSs had become a complete expression of his 
personality. And so what happened? Whenever he 
disturbed some one, he was immediately punished. 
He would get a bad report card or else a letter of 
complaint would he sent to his parents. Things went 
on in this way until at length his parents were ad- 
vised to remove the boy from school, since he did not 
seem suited for school life. 

Probably nobody was happier than the boy at 
such a solution. He did not want anything else. The 
logical consistency of his behavior pattern revealed 
itself again in his attitude. It was a mistaken atti- 
tude, but once assumed it expressed itself consis- 
tently. He had made his basic mistake when he had 
set for himself the goal of always being the center of 
attention. And if he was to be punished for any 
mistake, this is the mistake for which he should have 
been punished. It was as a result of this mistake that 
he tried constantly to make his mother wait on him. 
And it was as a result of this mistake, too, that he 
acted like a king who, after eight years of absolute 
power, is suddenly deprived of his throne. Up to the 
moment of his dethronement he had been the only 
one who existed for his mother, and she for him. 
Then his sister arrived, and he struggled violently 
to recover his lost throne. That was again his mis- 


 
take, but one must grant that such a blunder does 
not involve any inherent badness or vicioiiseess. Vi- 
ciousness first develops when a child is brought into 
a situation for which he is totally unprepared, and is 
allowed to struggle without any guidance. Take a 
child, for example, who has been prepared only for 
a situation in which some one devotes herself entirely 
to him; suddenly the contrary is true. The child is 
at school, where the teacher must divide his attention 
among many, and is rather annoyed when one child 
demands more than his proportionate share. Such 
a situation is full of danger for the pampered child, 
but at the outset the child is far from being vicious 
or incorrigible. 

It is understandable that in the case of the boy a 
conflict should have developed between his personal 
scheme of existence and the scheme of existence de- 
manded by the school. The conflict may be repre- 
sented diagrammatically by picturing the direction 
and the goal of the child’s personality and the goal 
set by school life. The goals point in diverging di- 
rections. But everything that happens in the child’s 
life is determined by his goal, and there is no mo- 
tion, so to speak, in his whole system except in the 
direction of this goal. On the other hand the school 


 
expects a normal scheme of existence for every child« 
The conflict is InevitaMe, but the school fails to ap- 
preciate the psychological facts in the situation and 
neither makes any allowances for it nor attempts to 
obviate the source of the conflict. 

We know that the child’s life is motivated by the 
dominant desire to make his mother serve him and 
him alone. In his psychological scheme of existence 
everjdhing may be said to converge on this thought : 
I must dominate my mother, I must be the only one 
to possess her. But other things are expected of him. 
It is expected of him that he work alone, that he take 
care of his school books and papers, and that he keep 
his possessions in order. It is as if one hitched a fiery 
race horse to a truck wagon. 

Of course the hoy’s performance in such a case is 
not of the highest, hut when we know what the real 
circumstances are we are much more inclined to be 
sympathetic. It is no use to punish the boy in school, 
because that would definitely convince him that 
school is no place for him. When he is expelled from 
school, or when the parents are asked to take him 
away, the boy is that much nearer to his goal. His 
false scheme of apperception acts like a trap. He 
feels that he has gained, because he now really has 

rubWt 


mss 


 
Ills iiiotlier in his power. She must again devote her- 
self exclusively to him. And that is just what lie 
wants. 

When we recognize the true state of affairs we 
must admit that it is of no use to pick one fault or 
another and punish the child for it. Suppose for ex- 
ample that he forgets a book — would be a wonder 
if he didn’t, for when he forgets it he gives his mother 
something to do. It is not an isolated individual act, 
it is part of the whole scheme of personality. When 
we bear in mind that all the expressions of a per- 
sonality are consistent parts of a whole, we can see 
that this boy is acting simply in accordance with his 
style of life. And the fact that he acts consistently, 
in accordance with the logic of his personality, at 
the same time disproves any presumption that his in- 
ability to perform his school tasks is due to feeble- 
mindedness. A feeble-minded person is unable to 
follow out his own style of life. 

This highly complex case brings up still another 
point. We are all of us in a somewhat similar situa- 
tion to that of this boy. OiSr own schemes, our own 
interpretations of life are never in complete har- 
mony with the received social tradition. In the old 
days one looked upon the social tradition as sacro- 
sanct ; now we have come to realize, however, that 



 
there is nothing sacred or fixed about the social in- 
stitutions of humanity. They are all in process of 
developmentj and the motive power in that process 
is the struggle of the individuals within society. So- 
cial institutions exist for the sake of the individual 
and not the individual for the sake of social insti- 
tutions. The salvation of the indi\’idual lies indeed 
ill being social-minded, but social-mindedness does 
not imply forcing the individual into a Procrustean 
social mould. 

Such considerations on the relation of the in- 
dividual to society, ’Which lie at the basis of the doc- 
trines of Individual Psychology, apply with special 
force to the school system and its treatment of mal- 
adjusted children. The school must learn to regard 
the child as a personality, as a value to be cultivated 
and developed, and at the same time it must learn 
to use psychological insight in judging particular 
acts. It must regard these particular actSj as we have 
said, not as single notes but in the context of the 
whole melody — the unity of personality. 




CHAPTEH THEEE 


THE STRIVING FOR SUPERIORITY AND ITS 
EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

N ext to the unity of personality the most im- 
portant psychological fact about human na- 
ture is the striving for superiority and success. This 
striving is of course directly related to the feeling of 
inferiority, for if vre did not feel inferior we should 
not have any desire to go beyond the immediate 
situation. The two problems — tlie desire for su- 
perlority and the sense of inferiority — are really 
two phases of the same psychological phenomenon, 
but for purposes of exposition it is convenient to 
treat them more or less separately. In this chapter 
we shall try to confine ourselves to the striving for 
superiority and its educational consequences. 

The first question that one may ask about the striv- 
ing for superiority is whether it is innate, like our 
biological instincts. The answer we must give is that 
this is a highly improbable supposition. We cannot 
really speak of the superiority striving as in any 



 
definite sense inborn. However, we must admit that 
a substrate must exist — ^there must be an embryonic 
core with the possibilities of development. Perhaps 
we may put it best this way; human nature is tied up 
with the development of the striving for superiority. 

We know, of course, that human activities are 
confined within certain bounds, and that there are 
abilities which we can never develop. For example, 
we can never attain the smell faculty of a dog; nor 
is it possible to perceive with our eyes the ultra-violet 
rays of the spectrum. But there are certain func- 
tional abilities which can be developed further, and 
it is in this possibility of fm*ther development that 
we see the biological root of the striving for superior- 
ity and the whole source of the psychological un- 
folding of personality. 

As far as we can see, this dynamic urge to assert 
one’s self under all circumstances is common both to 
children and adults. There is no way of exterminat- 
ing it. Human nature does not tolerate permanent 
submission; humanity has even overthrown its gods. 
The feeling of degradation and depreciation, the 
mood of uncertainty and of inferiority always give 
rise to a desire for reaching a higher level in order 
to obtain compensation and completeness. 

We can show that certain peculiarities of children 


 
betray the work of enTironmental forces wliicli de- 
velop ill them feelings of inferiority, weakness and 
uncertainty, which in turn exercise a stimulating 
influence upon their whole mental life. They make it 
their aim to free themselves from this condition, to 
reach a higher level and to gain a feeling of equality. 
The more stormy the upward aspirations are, the 
higher the child sets his aims, looking for proofs of 
his strength — ^proofs which often transcend the 
limits of human powers. Because of the support that 
he sometimes obtains from various quarters, the 
cliild is enabled to project a picture of the future 
bordering on God. In one way or another the imag“ 
ination of children is apt to betray the fact that they 
are possessed with the idea of divine resemblance. 
This generally occurs in children who feel weakest. 

There is the case of a child of fourteen years who 
found himself in a very bad mental situation. When 
he was asked for childhood impressions, he remem- 
bered how painful it was for him to realize that he 
was unable to whistle at the age of six. One day, 
however, as he came out of his house he succeeded in 
whistling. He was so surprised that he believed that 
it was God who whistled in him. This shows clearly 
that there is an intimate and close connection be- 



 
tween the feeling of weakness on the one hand and 
the nearness of God on the other. 

This aspiration for superiority is connected with 
striking character traits. By observing this tendency 
we witness the whole ambition of such a child. When 
this desire for self-assertion becomes extraordinarily 
intense, it will also always involve an element of 
envy. Children of this type easily develop the habit 
of wishing their competitors all kinds of evils ; and 
not only wishing — which often leads to neurosis — 
but also doing harm, causing trouble, and eyen man- 
ifesting now and then downright criminal traits. 
Such a child can slander, betray domestic secrets and 
degi’ade the other fellow so as to feel that his own 
value is enhanced, especially when he is being ob- 
served by others. No one is supposed to surpass him, 
therefore it does not matter to him whether he him- 
self rises or the other fellow sinks in value. WTien the 
desire for power becomes very strong, it expresses 
itself in malevolence, vindictiveness. These children 
will always display a militant and defiant attitude, 
which will show itself in their external appearance 
—in the flashing of their eyes, in their sudden out- 
bursts of anger, in their readiness to fight imaginary 
foes. To be submitted to a test is, for children aim- 


 
ing at superiority, an extremely painful situation, 
for in this way their worthlessness might easily be 
exposed. 

This fact shows that it is necessary to adapt the 
tests to the peculiarities of the child. A test does not 
mean the same thing to every child. We can often 
find children for whom a test is a highly burdensome 
event, who blush and turn pale, begin to stutter and 
tremble, who are so paralyzed by shame and fear 
that their minds become blank. Some can answer 
only in unison with others, otherwise they cannot an- 
swer at ail because they suspect that they are being 
watched. This desire for superiority will also mani- 
fest itself in plays. An intense desire for superiority 
in this direction will not allow the child to play the 
part of a horse at the time when others appear as 
drivers. He will always want to be the driver him- 
self, he will always attempt to lead and direct. But 
when he is kept back by past experience from assum- 
ing such a role, he will content himself with disturb- 
ing the games of others. And if he is still further dis- 
couraged by numerous defeats, his ambition will be 
thwarted, and any new situation will drive him back 
instead of stimulating him to go forward. 

Ambitious children who have not yet been dis- 
couraged will display inclinations for competitive 


 
games of all kinds, and they will equally manifest 
consternation in case of defeat. The degree and di- 
rection of the desire for self-assertion can often be 
inferred from favorite games, tales, historical fig- 
ures, persons. In the case of adults we often find 
the worship of Napoleon, who is highly fit to serve 
as a model for ambitious people. Megalomania in 
day-dreaming is always a sign of a strong feeling of 
inferiority which stimulates disappointed people to 
look for satisfaction and intoxication in feelings pro- 
duced outside of reality. Something similar often 
takes place in dreams. 

In observing the different directions which chil- 
dren take in their striving for superiority, variations 
become apparent which we can divide into certain 
types. We cannot make this type division a precise 
one because the variations are innumerable, and are 
determined primarily by the amount of confidence 
the child has in himself. Children whose development 
has not been hindered direct this striving for su- 
periority into the channels of useful accomplish- 
ment ; they try to please their teachers, to be orderly, 
to develop into normal school youngsters. We know 
from our experience, however, that these cases are 
not in the majority. 

There are also children who want to excel others 


 
and who manifest a suspicious intensity in their 
struggle to surpass. Frequently there is a note of 
exaggerated ambition in such a striving which is 
easily overlooked because we are accustomed to re- 
gard ambition as a virtue and to stimulate the child 
to further effort. This is usually a mistake because 
the development of a child suffers from too much 
ambition. A swollen ambition produces a state of 
tension which the child can bear for a while, but 
inevitably there will be signs that the tension is grow- 
ing too great. The child may spend too much time 
at home with his books and his other activities will 
suffer. Such children frequently avoid other prob- 
lems solely on account of their eagerness to be ahead 
in school. We cannot be completely satisfied with 
such a development since a child cannot thrive men- 
tally and physically under such circumstances. 

The way in which such a child arranges his life to 
be able to surpass all others is not best suited to a 
normal growth. There comes a time when he must 
be told not to spend so much time with his books, to 
go out into the air, to play with his friends and oc- 
cupy himself with other things. Such children are 
likewise not in the majority, but they occur fre- 
quently enough. 





 

In additioiij it often happens that there are two 
pupils ill a class between whom there is a tacit 
rivaliy« He who has the opportunity to observe 
closely will find that such competing children occa- 
sionally develop traits which are not particularly 
agreeable. They become envious and jealous, quali- 
ties which certainly do not belong to an independ- 
ent, harmonious personality. They are annoyed at 
the successes of other children, they commence to 
have nervous headaches, stomach aches, etc., when 
some one else forges ahead. They withdraw to one 
side when another child is praised, and of course they 
will never be able to praise somebody else. This is a 
sign of envy which does not throw such a good light 
upon exaggerated ambition. 

Such children do not get along well with their 
comrades. They want the leading part in every- 
thing and are unwilling to subordinate themselves 
to the general organization of a game. The result 
is that they do not like to play in company and act 
haughtily toward their schoolmates. Every contact 
with their schoolmates is to them unpleasant; the 
more so, the more insecure they believe their position 
to be. Such children are never sure of their success 
and are easily rattled when they feel themselves in 


 
an insecure atmosphere. They are overburdened by 
the expectations which others have in regard to tlieiiis 
and also by their own expectations of tliemselves. 

The expectations that the families have of such 
children are felt very keenly by the children them- 
selves. They go about fulfilling every task that is set 
before them with excitement and nervousness be- 
cause they have always before their eyes the vision 
of surpassing all others, of being a “shining light.” 
They feel the weight of the hopes which rest on them, 
and they will carry this weight only so long as cir- 
cumstances are favorable. 

If human beings were blessed with absolute truth 
and were able to find a perfect method which would 
spare children such difficulties, we should probably 
have no behavior problem children. Since we do not 
have such a method, and since the conditions under 
which children must learn cannot be ideally ar- 
ranged, it is obvious that the anxious expectations 
of such children are an extraordinarily dangerous 
matter. They will face a difficulty with quite differ- 
ent feelings from those which other children have 
who are not burdened with such unhealthy ambition. 
By difficulties we mean those which are unavoid- 
able, It is and probably always will be impossible to 
prevent a child from encountering difficulties. This 



 


is partly due to our methods which are in need of 
further development, which do not suit every child, 
and which we are constantly seeking to improve. It 
is also due to the fact that the confidence which chil- 
dren have in themselves is undermined by an exag- 
gerated ambition. Difficulties are not faced with the 
courage necessary to overcome them. 

Over-ambitious children are concerned only with 
the end result which is the recognition accorded their 
success. The success itself does not satisfy without 
the recognition. We know that in many cases it is 
much more important for a child to maintain his 
mental balance when difficulties present themselves 
than actually to attempt to conquer these difficulties 
at once. A child who has been forced into such an 
ambitious direction does not know this, and feels it is 
impossible to live without the admiration of others. 
The result is everywhere observable in the number of 
people dependent upon the opinion of others. 

How important it is not to lose the sense of bal- 
ance in the matter of values is shown by the example 
of those children who come into the world with organ 
inferiorities. Such cases are, of course, quite com- 
mon. Many children are better developed on the left 
than on the right side; this is a fact which is usually 
unknown. A left-handed child has many difficulties 
. 45 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDHEN 


in our riglit-handed civilization. It is necessary to 
use certain metliods to discover whether a cliiid is 
right or left-handed. Almost without exception we 
find left-handed children among those who have ex- 
ceptional difficulty in writing, reading and drawing, 
and who are generally awkward with their hands. 
One simple, but not entirely conclusive method for 
finding out whether a child is congenitally right- 
or left-handed, is to ask the child to cross his hands. 
Left-handed children usually cross their hands so 
that the left thumb lies over the right. It is astound- 
ing to see how many people are born left-handed and 
have never known it. 

When we investigate the history of a large num- 
ber of left-handed children, we find the following 
facts : first, that such children were usually regarded 
as clumsy or awkward (which is no wonder in our 
right-handed arrangement of things). To under- 
stand the situation, it is only necessary to think how 
perplexing it is, when we have been accustomed to 
right-handed traffic, to attempt to cross the street in 
a town where traffic is to the left (England, for ex- 
ample, or Argentina). A left-handed child finds 
himself in an even worse situation in a family where 
all the others are right-handed. His left-handedness 
disturbs both the family and himself. When he 
m 



 
learns to write in school, he finds himself below the 
average. As the reason is not understood, he is 
scolded, receives bad marks, and is often punished. 
The child cannot interpret his situation otherwise 
than to believe that he is in some way less capable 
than the others. A feeling will grow in him of hav- 
ing been curtailed, of being in some way inferior, 
or of not being able to compete with the others. 
Since he is scolded at home also for his clumsiness, 
he sees there only a confirmation of his inferiority. 

Naturally the child does not have to accept this as 
a final defeat, but there are many children who give 
up the struggle under such disheartening condi- 
tions. Since they do not understand the real situation 
and no one explains to them how to overcome their 
difficulties, it is hard for them to keep on fighting. 
Many people, on this account, have an illegible hand- 
writing because they have never trained their right 
hands sufficiently. That this obstacle can be over- 
come is proven by the fact that one finds left-handed 
persons among the best artists and painters, and also 
among script engravers. These persons have de- 
veloped an ability to use their right hands simply by 
force of training despite their congenital left- 
handedness. 

There is a superstition that all left-handed per- 


 
sons wlio are trained to use their right hand become 
stutterers. This superstition is explained by the fact 
that the difficulties put in the way of such children 
are sometimes so great that they may lose their 
courage to speak. That is also why there is such an 
unusual number of left-handed persons to be found 
among those who manifest other forms of discour- 
agement (neurotics, suicides, criminals, perverse in- 
dividuals, etc.). On the other hand, one often finds 
that those people who have overcome their left- 
handedness have also achieved high rank in life, fre- 
quently in an artistic atmosphere. 

No matter how insignificant the single character- 
istic of left-handedness may appear, it still teaches 
us something of great importance ; namely, that we 
can determine nothing of the ability of a child until 
we have brought his courage and perseverance up to 
a certain point. When we frighten the children, take 
away from them the hope of a better future, it may 
still appear to us that they are capable of carrying 
on. But if we were to increase their courage, such 
children would he capable of accomplishing much 
more. 

Children with inordinate ambition are in a bad 
situation because it is customary to judge them by 
their success and not according to their prepared- 



 
ness to face difficulties and to combat them. It is also 
eustomary in our present form of civilization to be 
mucli more concerned with visible success than with 
thorough education. We know how perishable is that 
success which comes to us with little effort. It can 
therefore be of no advantage to train a child to be 
ambitiouso It is much more important to train him 
to be courageous, persevering and self-confident, to 
recognize that failure should never discourage, but 
should be tackled as a new problem. It would cer» 
tainly be much easier if the teacher were able to 
recognize at what point a child’s efforts seemed fu- 
tile and also whether the child made sufficient effort 
in the first place. 

We see, therefore, that a striving for superiority 
can express itself in a character trait like ambition. 
There are children whose striving for superiority 
originally took the form of ambition, but who re- 
linquished this ambition as unattainable because an- 
other child had already gotten so very much further 
ahead. Many teachers follow the practice of treating 
children who do not manifest sufficient ambition 
very severely, or giving them bad marks in order 
to arouse their dormant ambition. Occasionally this 
method is successful if there is still some courage left 
in the child. However, this method is not to he recoin- 


 
mended for general use. Children already close to 
the danger line in their studies become completely 
confused and are driven into a state of apparent stu- 
pidity by such treatment. 

On the other hand, we are often astounded at the 
unsuspected intelligence and capability which chil- 
dren manifest after having been handled with gen- 
tleness, care and understanding. It is true that chil- 
dren who change in this fashion frequently exhibit 
a greater ambition. This is simply because they are 
afraid of falling back to the old state. Their old way 
of living and the past lack of accomplishment re- 
main before their eyes like warning signals and con- 
tinually urge them forward. In later life many of 
them behave as if possessed by a demon ; they occupy 
themselves day and night, suffer constantly from the 
effects of overwork, and believe that they are never 
doing enough. 

All this becomes much clearer when we keep in 
mind the dominant idea of Individual Psychologj^ 
that every individual’s personality (child as well as 
adult) is a unified whole,*^ and that it always ex- 
presses itself in accordance with the behavior pat- 
tern which he has gradually built up. To judge an 
act detached from the personality of the actor is 
wrong because a specific and single act can be inter- 



 
preted in many ways. The uncertainty in judging 
Yanislies at once when we comprehend the particular 
act or gesture — for example, tardiness — as the in- 
evitable answer of the child to the tasks set him by 
the school. It means simply that he would rather 
have nothing to do with the school, and consequently 
that he does not bother to fulfill the school’s require- 
ments. In fact he does what he can in order not to 
comply with them. 

From this standpoint we can see the whole picture 
of the “bad” school child. We see the tragedy that 
takes place when the striving for superiority ex- 
presses itself not in the acceptance of school hut in 
the rejection of it. A series of typical behavior symp- 
toms appear and gradually these symptoms ap- 
proach closer and closer to incorrigibility and retro- 
gradation. The child may turn into the type like the 
court jester. He constantly plays pranks to make 
others laugh and does little else. Or he may annoy 
his comrades. Or else he plays truant and falls in 
mth evil companions. 

We see, then, how nol; only does the fate of the 
school child lie in our hands, but the later develop- 
ment of the individual as well. The education and 
training furnished by the school determine in a cru- 
cial fashion the future life of the individual. The 
■ 51 . 


 
school is placed in between the family and life in 
society. It has the opportunity of correcting the mis- 
taken styles of life formed nnder family upbringiiig, 
and it has the responsibility of preparing the child’s 
adjustment to social life and of seeing to it that the 
child will play his indmdnai role harmoniously in 
the orchestral pattern of society. 

When we view the role of the school historically 
we see that it has always tried to turn out individuals 
according to the social ideal of the time. It was suc- 
cessively an aristocratic, religious, bourgeois and 
democratic school, always educating the children ac- 
cording to what the times and the rulers demanded. 
To-day in accordance with the changing social ideal 
the school must change also. Thus if to-day the ideal 
adult human being is typified by the independent, 
self-controlled and courageous man or woman, the 
school must regulate itself so that it will turn out in- 
dividuals approaching that ideal. 

In other words the school must not regard itself 
as an end in itself and must keep in mind that the in- 
dividual must be trained fcTr society and not for the 
school. Thus it must not neglect the children who 
have given up the ideal of being model children at 
school. These children do not necessarily have less 



 
of a striving for superiority. They can turn their at- 
tention to other things where they do not have to 
strain themselves^ and where they believes either 
rightly or wrongly, that success is easier to achieve. 
This may he due to the fact that they have uncon- 
sciously trained themselves in their earlier years for 
other activities. Thus they may not become bril- 
liant mathematicians, but they may distinguish 
themselves in athletics. The educator should never 
dismiss any such salient accomplishment but should 
use it as a point of departure to encourage the child 
to improve in other spheres of activity. The educa- 
tor’s task is much easier when he starts with a single 
encouraging accomplishment and uses it to make the 
child believe he can be just as successful in other 
things. It is enticing the child, as it were, from one 
fruitful pasture to another. And since all children, 
except those who are feeble-minded, are quite ca- 
pable of coping successfully with their school work, 
wliat needs to be overcome is simply an artificially 
constructed barrier. This barrier arises from taking 
abstract school performance, instead of the ultimate 
educational and social goal, as the basis for judg- 
ment. On the child’s side the barrier is reflected in a 
lack of self-confidence, with the result that the child’s 


 


striving for superiority may bring out a break with 
useful activity because it does not find its proper ex- 
pression, 

Wliat does the child do in such a situation? He 
thinks of a way of escape. Often we may find him 
assuming some peculiarity which does not actually 
draw praise from the teacher, but which may attract 
the teacher’s attention, or may only arouse the ad- 
miration of the other children at such a display of im- 
pertinence or stubbornness. Such a child, by virtue 
of the disturbance he creates, often regards himself 
as a hero, and as a little giant. 

Such psychological manifestations and deviations 
from proper conduct arise in the course of the school 
experiment. Their origin cannot be traced alto- 
gether to the school, although it is in school that they 
come to the surface. The school, taken in a passive 
sense, that is to say, apart from its active educational 
and corrective mission, is an experiment station 
where the defects of the early family upbringing are 
brought to light. 

A good and watchful teacher can see many things 
the first day a child is in school. For many children 
show at once all the signs of a pampered child to 
whom the new situation (the school) is most painful 
and disagreeable. Such a child has had no practice 



THE EDUCATION OF CHILDKEN' 
in making contacts with others, and it is essential 
that lie be able to make friends. It is better and 
preferable that a child bring with him to school some 
knowledge of how to establish contact with others. 
He must not be dependent upon one person to the 
exclusion of all others. The fault of family upbring- 
ing must be corrected at school, but it is of course 
better that be come to the school more or less free 
from such a fault. 

A child who has been pampered at home cannot 
be expected to be suddenly able to concentrate on his 
work at school. Such a child is not attentive. He will 
manifest a desire to remain at home rather than go 
to school — in fact he will have no “school sense.” 
It is easy to detect the signs of this aversion to school. 
Thus the parents have to coax the child to get up in 
the morning; they must constantly urge him to do 
this or that ; they will find him dawdling over break- 
fast, and so on. It %voiiid seem as if such a child has 
constructed an impassable barrier to prevent bis 
making progress. 

The cure, the remedy for the situation, is the same 
as with left-handed persons : we must give such chil- 
dren time to learn, and we must not punish them 
when they come late to school because that only in- 
creases their sense of unhappiness at school. Such 


 
punishment is regarded by the child as confirmatory 
of his feeling that he does not belong in school When 
parents whip a child in order to force him to go to 
school the child will not only not want to attend 
school but will look for means to make his position 
more bearable. These means will, of course, be means 
of escape, not means of actually meeting the diffi- 
culty, The child’s aversion to school, his inability to 
cope with the school problem will he apparent in 
every gesture and in every movement. He will never 
have his books together and will always be forget- 
ting or losing them. When a child makes a habit of 
forgetting and losing books we may be certain that 
he is not on very good terms with his school. 

In examining such children one finds almost in- 
variably that they had no hope of being able to 
achieve any measure of success at school. This self- 
undervaluation is not entirely their own fault. The 
environment has helped them along in this mistaken 
direction. At home some one in anger has prophesied 
a dark future, or has called them stupid or worth- 
less. When these children find at school what ap- 
pears to be a confirmation of such accusations, they 
jack the judgment, the power of analysis (which 
their eiders often also lack) to correct their misin- 
terpretation. They thus give up the battle before 



 
tliey even make an attempt at combat, and they con- 
sider the defeat which they themselves bring about 
as an insiiraioimtable obstacle and as a confirmation 
of their inability or inferiority. 

Since circumstances are usually such that, once a 
mistake is made, there is little possibility of having 
the mistake corrected, and since these children 
usually lag behind in spite of their apparent efforts 
to forge ahead, the}^ soon give up the effort and turn 
their attention to inventing excuses for staying 
away from school. Absence from school, that is to 
say, truancy, is one of the most dangerous symptoms. 
It is regarded as one of the worst sins, and the pun- 
ishment is usually drastic. Thereupon the children 
believe themselves compelled to take refuge in cun- 
ning and in misrepresentation. There still remain a 
few paths which lead them into further misdeeds. 
They can forge notes from home and falsify report 
cards. They can spin a net of lies at home about all 
they are supposed to be doing at school, which place 
they have not attended for some time. They also have 
to find a place to hide during school hours. It goes 
without saying that they usually find in such hiding 
places other children who have already trodden this 
path. And so the children’s striving for superiority 
remains unsatisfied after merely playing truant — it 


 
urges them to further acts, that is to say, to law- 
breaking. They go further and further, ending up 
with full-fledged criminality. They form gangs, 
they begin to steal, they learn sexual perversions, 
and they feel themselves quite grown up. 

The great step having been taken, they now search 
for more food for their ambition. Inasmuch as they 
have remained undetected in their acts, they feel 
that they can commit the most cunning of crimes. 
This explains why so many children will not give up 
their life of crime. They want to go further in their 
development along that road because they believe 
that they can never achieve success in any other di- 
rection. They have excluded everything which might 
stimulate them to useful activity. Their ambition, 
continually stimulated by the deeds of their com- 
rades, drives them to new a-social or anti-social acts. 
One never finds a child with criminal tendencies who 
is not at the same time extremely conceited. This 
conceit has the same source as ambition, and it forces 
the child continually to distinguish himself in some 
way or other. And when he cannot make a place for 
himself on the useful side of life, he turns to the use- 
less side. 

There is the case of a boy who killed his teacher. 
If we examine the case we find all the characteristic 



 
traits in this boy. It is a boy who had a careful but 
too nervous an upbringing under the guidance of a 
governess wdio believed that she knew everything 
there was to know about the expression and function 
of mental life. The boy lost faith in himself because 
his ambition passed from exaggerated heights to 
nothing — that is to say, to sheer discouragement. 
Life and school did not fulfill his expectations, and 
so he turned to law-breaking. By law-breaking he 
passed out of the control of the educator and the 
child guidance expert, for society has not yet devised 
the apparatus for treating criminals, especially ju- 
venile criminals, as educational problems — prob- 
lems in the correction of psychological mistakes. 

There is a curious fact that is familiar to any one 
who has ever had much to do with pedagogy, and 
that is the frequency with which we find wayward 
children in the families of teachers, ministers, doc- 
tors and lawyers. This applies not merely to educa- 
tors without much professional standing but also 
♦ 

to those whose opinions we regard as important. 
Despite their professional authority they seem to be 
unable to bring about jieace and order in their own 
families. The explanation is that in all such fam- 
ilies certain important viewpoints have either been 
■■■• ' 59 ; " 


 
entirely overlooked or not comprehended. Part of 
the difficulty comes, for instance, from the strict 
rules and regulations which the educator-parent, by 
means of his assumed authority, tries to force on his 
family. He oppresses his children too severely. He 
threatens their independence and often indeed robs 
them of it. It seems as if he arouses in them a mood 
which compels them to take revenge for this op- 
pression, which is rooted in their memory by the rod 
with which they have been beaten. Also it must be 
remembered that deliberate pedagogy leads to an 
extraordinarily sharpened observation. For the most 
part this is of great advantage, but in the case of 
one’s own children it results often in making the 
children want to be constantly in the center of at- 
tention, They regard themselves as a display ex- 
periment, and they , look upon the others as the 
responsible and determining parties. These others 
have to remove all the difficulties and the children 
themselves feel free of any responsibility.
