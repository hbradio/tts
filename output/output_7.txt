CHAPTER TEN 


THE CHILD AT SCHOOL 

W HEN a child enters school he finds him- 
self, as we have said, in a situation that 
is wholly new to him. Like all new situations en- 
trance into school can be regarded as a test of pre- 
vious preparation. If the child has been properly 
trained he will pass the test in a normal manner; 
if not, the defects in his preparation will become 
clearly apparent. 

We do not often take records of a child’s psy- 
chological preparedness at the time he enters nurs- 
ery school and elementary school, but such records, 
if we had them, would shed great light on behavior 
in adult life. Such “new situation tests” would be 
infinitely more revealing than ordinary tests cf 
scholastic performance. 

What is demanded of a child when he enters 
school? School work is a task that demands co- 
operation with the teacher and with the school- 
mates, as well as an interest in the school subjects, 


 
By the child's responses to this new situation we 
can gauge his degree of co-operative ability and 
Ms sphere of interest. We can tell in what subjects 
the child is interested ; we can see whether he is in- 
terested in what another person says; we can tell 
whether he is interested in anything at all. We can 
ascertain all these facts by studying the attitude of 
the child, his posture and look, the way he listens, 
whether he approaches the teacher in a friendly 
manner, or whether he stays far away from him, 
etc. 

How these details affect one’s psychological de- 
velopment may be illustrated by the case of a cer- 
tain man, who consulted a psychologist because he 
had difficulties in his profession. Looking back into 
his childhood, the psychologist discovered that he 
had grown up in a family in which all the other 
children were girls ; also the parents died soon after 
he was born. When the time came to enter school, 
he did not know whether he should register in the 
girls’ or in the boys’ scjiool. He was persuaded by 
his sisters to enter the girls’ school, only to be dis- 
missed from there in a very short time. We can 
imagine the impression it left on the child’s mind. 

Concentration on school subjects is largely de- 
pendent upon the child’s interest in his teacher. It 
■ ■ ■ , 167 ; 


 
is part of tlie teacher’s art to keep a child attentive, 
and to find out when a child is not attentive or is 
irnahie to concentrate. There are many cliildren 
who come to school without any ability for con- 
centration. They are generally the pampered chil- 
dren, who are dazed by the presence of so many 
strange persons. If the teacher should happen to 
be a little strict, it will appear as if such children 
have no memory. But this lack of memory is not so 
simple a fact as it is generally regarded. A child 
who is reproached by the teacher with having no 
memory has a memory for other things. He is even 
able to concentrate, but only for the situation in 
which he has been pampered at home. He is atten- 
tive to his desire to be pampered, but not for school 
work. 

If such a child does not get on in school, if he has 
had reports and does not pass his examinations, it 
is useless to criticize him or reproach him. Criticism 
and reproaches will not change his style of life. On 
the contrary such things will convince him that he 
is not fit for school and will make him develop a 
pessimistic attitude. 

It is significant that pampered children, when 
they are won over by the teacher, are often very 


 
good pupils. They can work when they have a great 
advantage for themselves; unfortunately we can- 
not guarantee that they will always . be pampered at 
scliooL If the child changes schools or changes 
teacherSj or even if he does not make progress in a 
particular subject (and arithmetic is always a dan- 
gerous subject for pampered children), he will 
suddenly come to a stop. He will not be able to go 
ahead because he has been accustomed to having 
everything made easy for him. He has never been 
trained to struggle and does not know how to 
struggle. He has no patience for meeting difficul- 
ties and forging ahead by conscious efforts. 

We see, then, what is meant by sound prepara- 
tion for school. In bad preparation, we can always 
see the influence of the mother. We can understand 
how she was the first to awaken the interest of the 
child, and thus had the crucial responsibility of di- 
recting that interest into healthy channels. If she 
failed in her responsibility, as she often did, the 
result was made evident in the child’s behavior at 
school. Besides the mother’s influence there is the 
whole complex of family influences — the influence 
of the father, the rivalry of the children, which ^Ye 
have analyzed in other chapters. Then, too, there 



 
are the outside influences, the bad circumstances 
and prejudices, about which we shall speak more at 
length in a succeeding chapter. 

In short, with all these circmnstances that ac- 
count for the bad preparation of the child, it is 
foolish to judge the child on the basis of his scholas- 
tic record. Rather should we take the school re- 
ports as so many indications of the child’s present 
psychological condition. It is not the marks that he 
gets but what they indicate as to his intelligence, in- 
terest, ability at concentration, etc. Scholastic tests 
should not be interpreted differently from such 
scientific tests as intelligence tests, despite the dif- 
ference in their construction. In both cases the em- 
phasis should be on what is revealed as to the child’s 
mind, and not as to the quantity of facts that are 
written down. 

In recent years the so-called intelligence tests 
have been very much developed. They have a great 
weight with teachers, and sometimes they are 
worth while, since they reveal things not shown 
by the ordinary tests. Once in a while they prove 
the salvation of the child. Thus when a hoy has had 
bad school reports and the teacher has wanted to 
put him into a lower class, the intelligence may 
suddenly reveal a higher rating. The child, instead 


 
of being put back, is allowed to skip a grade. He 
feels successful, and thereafter acts differently. 

We do not wish to undervalue the function of 
an intelligence test and of an I.Q., but we must 
say that when a test is used neither the child nor 
the parents should know the I.Q. Neither the par- 
ents nor the child know the true value of an in- 
telligence test. They imagine that it represents a 
final and complete point of view, that it indicates 
the fate of the child, who is henceforth limited by 
it. In reality the findings revealed by intelligence 
tests are quite open to criticism if they are taken as 
absolute findings. A good rating on an intelligence 
test is no guarantee for later life, and on the other 
hand grown-up persons who are otherwise success- 
ful make low scores. 

It has been the experience of Individual Psy- 
chologists that whenever intelligence tests reveal 
a great lack of intelligence, the scores can be im- 
proved if we find the right methods. One of these 
methods is to let the child play with the particular 
intelligence test until lie finds out the right trick, 
as well as the right preparation for taking such an 
examination. In this way the child makes progress 
and increases his experience. He will make better 
scores on subsequent tests. 



 

It is a gi’eat question as to how children are in- 
fluenced by the school routine, and whether they 
are not oppressed by the heavy school curriculum. 
We do not undervalue the subjects in the school 
curriculum, and we do not believe that the nmaber 
of subjects taught should be decreased. It is of 
course important to teach subjects in a coherent 
manner so that the children see the purpose and 
practical value of their subject and do not regard 
it as purely abstract and theoretical. There is great 
discussion at the present time over the question, 
shall we teach the child to learn subjects and facts, 
or shall we educate the child’s personality. We in 
Individual Psychology believe that the two can be 
combined. 

As have said, subjects of instruction should 
he made interesting and practical. Mathematics — 
arithmetic and geometry — should be taught in con- 
nection with the style and structure of a building, 
the number of people that can live there, etc. Some 
subjects can be taught together. In some of the 
more progressive schools we have experts who 
know how to teach subjects in interrelation. They 
take a walk with the children and find out that they 
are more interested in certain subjects than in 
others. They learn to combine instruction; they 


 
learn to combine, for example, instruction about 
the plant with the history of the plant, the climate 
of the country, etc. In this way they not only stimu- 
late interest in subjects which would otherwise be 
uninteresting to the child, but they give him a co- 
ordinated and synthetic approach to things, which 
is the final aim of all education. 

There is a point that educators must not over- 
look, and this is that children at school feel them- 
selves to be in a personal competition. We can 
readily understand why this point is important. 
The ideal school class should be a unit, in which 
each of the children feels himself a part of the 
whole. The teacher should see to it that the rival- 
ries and personal ambitions are kept within bounds. 
Children do not like to see others forge ahead, and 
either do not spare themselves to overtake their 
competitors or else suffer a relapse into disappoint- 
ment and a subjective view of things. That is why 
the advice and direction of the teacher is so im- 
portant — a proper word from him will transfer the 
energies of the child from competitive to co- 
operative channels. 

In this connection the institution of modified 
schemes of self-government in classes is helpful. 
We do not have to wait until children are com- 


 
pletely ready for seif "government to institute 
scliemes of this kind. We can allow the cliildren at 
first to watch what is going on, or to act in an ad- 
visory capacity. If children are given complete 
self-government without preparation, we shall find 
that they are more severe and strict in their pun- 
ishments than are the teachers, or even that they 
use their political functions for personal advantage 
and superiority. 

As regards the progress of the children through 
school, we have to take into account both the point 
of view of the teacher and the point of view of the 
children. It is an interesting fact that children 
have very good judgment in this regard. They 
Imow who is the best in spelling, in drawing, in 
athletics. They can rate each other quite well. 
Sometimes they are not quite just to others, but 
they realize this, and try to be fair. The great dif- 
ficulty is that they minimize themselves: they be- 
lieve, “Now, I can never catch up.” This is not 
true — they can catch up. .The mistake in their 
judgment must be pointed out to them, otherwise 
it will become an idee fiase throughout life. A child 
who has such an idea will never progress but will 
always stay where he is. 

The great majority of school children are nearly 

m 


EDUCATION OE CHILDREN 


always at the same level: they are the best or the 
vforst or the average, and they stay that way. This 
state of things does not reflect so much the de- 
velopment of the brain, as it does the inertia of 
psj^chological attitudes. It is. a sign that children 
have limited themselves and cease to be optimistic 
after the first few checks. But that fact that 
changes in relative position do take place once in 
a while is important: it shows that there is no fa- 
tality that governs the intellectual status of a child. ^ ; 

Children should know of this, and be brought to | 

understand its application in their own case. ^ 

Both the teacher and the children should also get - ' 

rid of the superstition that the results accomplished . ^ ! 

by children with normal intelligence should he at- ' : 

tributed to special heredity. This is perhaps the 
greatest mistake that is ever made in regard to the . jj 

education of children — ^this belief in the inheritance i ji 

of abilities. When Individual Psychology first / 

pointed this out, people thought that it was simply 
an optimistic conjecture on our part, not a general- ; 

ization based on science. But now more and more 
psychologists and psychiatrists are coming to ac- 
cept this point of view. Heredity is too easy a 
scapegoat for parents, teachers and children. j 

Whenever there are difficulties that require effort, | 



 
they can always call upon heredity to relieve them 
of any responsibility for doing things^ But we have 
no right to escape our responsibilitiesj and we 
should always be suspicious of any points of view 
that have the effect of releasing us from responsi- 
bilities. 

No educator who believes in the educative value 
of his work, who believes in education as the train* 
ing of character, can consistently accept the doc* 
trine of heredity. We are not concerned with phys* 
ical heredity. We know that organic defects, even 
differences in organic ability are inherited. But 
where is the bridge between the functioning of or- 
gans and the ability of the mind? In Individual 
Psychology we have insisted that the mind experi- 
ences the degree of ability possessed by the organs 
and has to reckon with it. Sometimes the mind 
reckons too much with it — in that it gets frightened 
by some organic disability, and the fright lasts long 
after the organic cause is removed. 

People always like to trace things back to their 
origins and to seek the germs from which the phe- 
nomena developed. But this point of view, which 
we constantly use in evaluating the achievements 
of persons, is very misleading. The usual error in 
this mode of procedure is to neglect most of the 


 
ancestors^ forgetting that if we are to construct 
family trees there are two parents at every genera- 
tion, If we trace back five generations there are 
doubtless find a clever person to whom to attribute 
the ability of his descendant. If we go back ten 
generations, we have 4,096 ancestors, and then 
there is no question but that we will find one very 
able person in the lot, if not more than one. It also 
must not be forgotten that the tradition given to a 
family by one very able person has an effect that 
resembles the working of heredity. We can thus 
understand how some families produce more able 
persons than other families. It is not inheritance, it 
is a very obvious and simple fact. Just consider 
how things used to work out in Europe when each 
child was forced to continue in the profession of 
the father. If we forget the social institutions the 
statistics of heredity can be made to look very for- 
midable. 

Next to the idea of, heredity the problem that 
causes the greatest difficulties for the child is the 
punishment for bad school reports. If a child has 
bad school reports, he will also find himself not 
very well liked by the teacher. He thus suffers in 
school, and then comes home and finds new scenes 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 
and new reproaches from his parents. He is scolded 
by his mother and father, and very often lie is 
spanked in addition. 

School-teachers should keep in mind the after- 
math of bad report cards. Some teachers believe 
that the child will struggle harder if he lias to show 
a bad report at home. But they forget the particu- 
lar home circumstances. In some homes the child is 
brought up in a rather cruel manner, and a child 
of such a home will think twice before bringing 
back a bad report. As a result he may not come at 
all, or sometimes he may be driven to the extremes 
of despair and commit suicide from fear of his 
parents. 

Teachers are not responsible for the school sys- 
tem, but it is well that wherever possible they tem- 
per the impersonal severities of the system ivith a 
personal touch of sympathy and understanding. 
Thus a teacher could be milder with a particular 
pupil on account of his home environment, and by 
being milder could encourage him instead of driv- 
ing him to despair. There is a heavy weight on the 
mind of a child who always gets bad reports and 
who continually is told by others that he is the 
worst pupil of the school until he believes it him- 
self. If we identify ourselves with such a child we 


 
can readity understand why he does not like scliooL 
It is only human. If any one were in a place where 
he was always criticized, had bad school reports, 
and lost the hope of ever catching up, he would not 
like the place and would try to escape from it. And 
so we should not be upset when we see such children 
staying away from school. 

But while we should not be alarmed at such an 
occurrence we should realize its significance. We 
should realize that it means a bad beginning, espe- 
cially if it happens in the period of adoIesceiice„ 
Such children are clever enough to protect them- 
selves by forging report cards, playing truant, etc. 
In this way they meet others of their own kind, 
form gangs, and start out on the road that leads 
eventually to crime. 

All this can be avoided if we accept the point of 
view of Individual Psychology that no child .should 
be thought hopeless. We must feel that a method 
can always be found to help a child. Even in the 
worst of circumstances, there is always a particular 
way of approach— but this of course needs to be 
found. 

Of the had results which follow from making 
children repeat classes, it is almost needless to 
speak. A teacher will agree that a child who repeats 


THE EDUCATION OE CHILDREN 


a class is a problem both for the school and. for the 
family. This may not happen in every case^ but the 
exceptions to the I'lile are very few. Most of those 
that repeat a class are chronic repeaters — ^tliey are 
always backward and present a problem which has 
always been evaded and never solved. 

It is a difficult question when to let children re- 
peat a class. There are teachers who manage to 
avoid the problem successfully. They use the va- 
cation periods to train the child, to search out the 
mistakes in his style of life and correct them, and 
so they are able to let him go on into the next class. 
This method could be practiced more widely if we 
had the institution of special tutors at school. W”e 
have social workers and visiting teachers, but no 
tutors. 

The institution of visiting teachers does not ex» 
ist in Germany, and it would seem to us as if such 
teachers are not altogether necessary. The class 
teacher in the public school has the best view in re- 
gard to the child. He can kpow more than others 
what is going on if he looks rightly. There are some 
that say that the class teacher cannot know the in- 
dividual pupils because the class is overcrowded. 
But if one observes how a child enters a school, one 
can see his style of life very soon and avoid many 


 
difficulties. This can be done even with a great 
crowd. One can educate a great number of clilMren 
better if one understands them than if one does not 
understand them. Overcrowded classes are far 
from a blessing and should be avoided, but they are 
not an insuperable obstacle. 

From the psychological point of view it is better 
that teachers do not change each year — or every 
six months as they do in some schools — ^but ad- 
vance with the class. If a teacher could be with the 
same children for two, three or four years, it would 
be a great advantage all around. Then the teacher 
would have an opportunity for knowing all the 
children intimately. He would be able to know the 
mistakes in each one’s style of life and correct 
them. 

Children often skip classes. Whether there is any 
advantage in this is debatable. Often they fail to 
satisfy the high expectations that have been awak- 
ened in them by the skipping process. Skipping a 
class should be considered in the case of a child who 
is too old for his grade. It should also be considered 
in the case of a child who was backward before and 
has since developed and improved. Skipping a 
class should not be held out as reward for better 
marks or because the child knows more than others. 



THE EBUCATION OF CHILDREN 
It is more to the advantage of a bright child if he 
devoted time to extra-school studies, like painting, 
music, etc. What the bright child learns in this way, 
is of advantage to the whole class, since it stiniu- 
lates the others. It is not good to deprive a class of 
the better pux)ils. There are those who say that we 
ahvays ought to promote the outstanding and 
bright children. We do not believe it. IVe believe 
rather that it is the bright children that push the 
whole class forward and give it a greater impetus 
for development. 

It is interesting to examine the two types of 
classes we find at school — ^the advanced and the 
backward classes. One is am^-zed to find in the ad- 
vanced classes a few children who are really feeble- 
minded, while the backward classes are peopled not 
with feeble-minded, as most persons think, but with 
children of poor families. Children of poor fam- 
ilies get the reputation of being backward. The 
reason is that their preparation is not so good. And 
we can readily understand this. The parents have 
too much to do and are not able to devote any time 
to the children, or perhaps are not well enough 
educated for this purpose. Such children who lack 
psychological preparation should not be put into 
the backward classes. Being in a backward class is 


 
a stigma for a cliild^ and the child is always ridi- 
culed b}/ liis comrades. 

A better way to take care of such children would 
be to apply the method of tutors, which we have al- 
ready mentioned. Besides tutors, there should be 
clubs, where children could go and get extra tutor- 
ing. There they could do their home work, play 
games, read books, etc. In this way .they would get 
a training in courage instead of a training in dis- 
couragement which is what they derive from classes 
for backward children. Such clubs, when combined 
with a greater abundance of pla5^grounds than we 
now have, would keep the children completely off 
the streets and away from bad influences. 

The question of co-education comes up in all dis- 
cussions of educational practice. As regards co- 
education, one may say that in principle we should 
promote it. It is a good way for girls and boys to 
get to know each other better. But, when one says 
co-education, and expects it to take care of itself, 
it is a great mistake. Co-education involves special 
problems that must be considered, or else the dis- 
advantages will overbalance the advantages. There 
is one fact, for example, that people generally 
overlook, and this is that girls up to their sixteenth 
yea,r develop more quickly than boys. If the boys 


 
do not realize this and see the girls get ahead faster 
than they do, they lose their balance and enter into 
a senseless race with the girls. Facts like these must 
be taken into consideration either by the adminis- 
tration or by the teacher in the class. 

Co-education can be successfully achieved by a 
teacher who likes co-education and understands the 
problems involved. But a teacher who does not like 
co-education will feel burdened by the system, and 
in his class co-education will fail. 

If the co-educational system is not properly ad- 
ministered and if the children are not rightly led 
and supervised, there will, of course, arise sex 
problems. We shall discuss sex problems more at 
length in a succeeding chapter. Here it may be 
pointed out that sex education in school presents a 
complicated problem. In fact the school is not the 
right place for imparting instruction about sex 
problems, because the teacher cannot know how 
the children will take his words when he speaks be- 
fore a whole class. It is different if the children ask 
for information privately from the teacher. If a 
girl asks the teacher for facts, the teacher should 
answer rightly. 

Returning now, after our digression on the more 
or less administrative phases of education, to the 


 
main heart of the problems we may say that we can 
always find out lio¥/ to educate children by con- 
sulting tlieir interests and finding out the subjects 
ill which they can be successful. Nothing succeeds 
like success. This is true of education as of other 
phases of human life. And it means that if a child 
is interested in one subject and is successful in it 
lie will be stimulated to go on to other things. It is 
up to the teacher to utilize the pupils’ successes as 
stepping-stones to greater knowledge. The pupil 
alone does not know how to do this — ^to lift him- 
self by his bootstraps, so to speak, as all of us must 
do in ascending from ignorance to knowledge. But 
the teacher can do this, and if he does it he will 
find that the pupil will see the point and will co- 
operate. 

What we have said about subjects of interest ap- 
plies also to the sense organs of children. We must 
find out which sense organ is the most used and 
what type of sensations fascinate the child most. 
There are many children who are better trained in 
seeing and looking, others in listening, still others 
in moving, etc. In recent j^ears the so-called manual 
schools have come into favor, and they utilize the 
sound principle of combining subjects of instruc- 
tion with the training of the eyes, ears and hands. 




 
The success of these schools is an indication of the 
importance of harnessing the physical interests of 
the child. 

If a teacher finds a child of the visual type^ lie 
should understand that he will have things easier 
in subjects in which he has to use Ills eyes — as for 
example geography. It will be better for him. to see 
than to listen to a lecture. This is a sample of the 
sort of insight into the problems of a particular 
child that a teacher should have. There are many 
other such insights which the teacher can get in his 
first look at the child. 

In short the ideal teacher has a sacred and fasci- 
nating task. He moulds the minds of children, and- 
the future of mankind is in his hands. 

But how shall we pass from the ideal to the ac- 
tual? It is not enough to envisage educational 
ideals. We must find a method to advance their 
realization. Long ago, in Vienna, the present 
writer started out to find such a method, and the 
result was the establishment of advisory clinics or 
guidance clinics in the schools.^' 

* See “Guiding the Child,” by Alfred Adler and Associates, Green- 
berg: Publisher, New York, -which gives a detailed account of the his- 
tory, technique and results of these clinics. 



 

The purpose of these clinics is to put the knowl- 
edge of modern psychology at the service of the 
educational sj^stem. A competent psychologist who 
understands not only psychology, but the life of 
the teachers and parents as well, joins with the 
teachers and holds a consultation clinic on a cer- 
tain day. On that day the teachers will have a meet- 
ing, and each one will bring up his particular cases 
of problem children. They will be cases of lazy 
children, children who corrupt the class, children 
who steal, etc. The teacher describes his particular 
cases, and then the psychologist will contribute his 
own experiences. Then the discussion starts. What 
are the causes? When did the situation develop? 
What should be done? The family life of the child 
and his whole psychological development is an- 
alyzed. With their combined knowledge, the group 
comes to a decision as to what should be done with 
a particular child. 

At the next session the child and the mother are 
both present. The mother will be called in first, 
after the manner of influencing her has been set- 
tled. The mother listens to the explanation of why 
the child has failed. Then the mother tells her side 
of the story, and a discussion starts between the 
mother and the psychologist. Generally the mother 
■ ■ ■ : ist : V 


 
is .quite happy to see all these signs of interest in 
her child’s case, and is glad to co-operate. If the 
mother is unfriendly and antagonistic, then the 
teacher or the psychologist begins to speak about 
similar eases and other mothers until the resistance 
is overcome. 

When, finally, the method of influencing the 
child is agreed upon, the child enters the room. He 
sees the teacher and the psychologist, and the psy^ 
chologist talks to him but not about his mistakes. 
The psychologist speaks as in a lecture, analyzing 
objectively — ^but in a manner that the child can 
grasp — the problems and the reasons and the ideas 
that are responsible for the failure to develop 
properly. The child is shown why he felt himself 
curtailed and other children preferred, how he 
came to despair of success, etc. 

This method has been followed for nearly fifteen 
years, and the teachers that have been trained in 
this work are quite happy and would not think of 
dropping the work that they have been carrying on 
for four, six and eight years. 

As for the children, they have gained doubly 
from this work: Those that were originally prob- 
lem children have been made whole — they have 
learned the spirit of co-operation and courage. The 



 
others^ too, who have not been called into the con- 
sultation clinics, have also benefited. When a sit- 
uation arises in the class that threatens to become 
a problem, the teacher will propose that the chil- 
dren talk the matter out. The teacher, of course, 
directs the discussion, but the children participate 
and have full opportunity for expression. They 
begin to analyze the causes of a problem — say, 
laziness in the class. In the end they will reach some 
conclusion, and the lazy child, who does not know 
that he is meant will, nevertheless, learn a great 
deal from the discussion. 

This summary account will give an indication of 
the possibilities that can be realized from the fusion 
of psychology and education. Psychology and edu- 
cation are two phases of the same reality and the 
same problem. To direct the mind we need to know 
its workings, and he who knows the mind and its 
workings cannot help but use his knowledge for di- 
recting the mind to higher and more universal 
goals.
