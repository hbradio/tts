CHAPTER FOUR 


DIRECTING THE SUPERIORITY STRIVING 

W E have seen that every diild has a striving 
for superiority. What a parent or edu- 
cator has to do is to direct this striving into a fruitful 
and useful channel. He has to see to it that the striv- 
ing is productive of mental health and happiness in- 
stead of neurosis and disorder. 

How is this to be done? "Wliat is the basis of dif- 
ferentiating between useful and useless manifesta- 
tions of the striving for superiority? The answer is, 
interest in the community. It is impossible to think 
of any achievement, anything worth while that any- 
body has ever done, that has no connection with the 
community. If we recall the great deeds which seem 
to us noble, lofty and valuable, we shall see that 
these deeds have been valuable not only to the doer 
but to the community at large. Hence the education 
of a child must be so organized that the child will 
recognize social feeling or a sense of solidarity with 
the community. 


 

Children who do not understand the notion of so- 
cial feeling become problem children. Tliej^ are sim- 
ply children whose striving for superiority has not 
been turned to use. 

It is true that there are wide differences of opin- 
ion as to what is useful to the community. One thing, 
however, is certain: we can judge a tree by its fruits. 
The results of any particular act will show whether 
it has been useful or useless to the community. This 
means that we must take account of time and effects. 
Eventually the act must intersect with the logic of 
reality, and this intersection with the logic of reality 
will show whether the act has any relevance to the 
needs of the community at large. It is the universal 
structure of things which is the standard of value, 
and sooner or later the contradiction or agreement 
with this standard is bound to come out. It is 
fortunate, moreover, that in ordinary life we do not 
find ourselves very often in a situation that requires 
a complicated technique of judgment. As regards 
social movements, political trends, etc., whose effect 
we cannot clearly foresee, there is room for contro- 
versy. However, even here — in the life of peoples 
as well as in individual lives — the effects ultimately 
indicate whether certain acts are useful and true or 
not. For from a scientific point of view we cannot 



 
call anything good or useful for all unless it is an 
absolute truth and a correct solution of the problem 
of life^ and the problem of life is conditioned by the 
earth, the cosmos, and the logic of human inter- 
relationship. These conditions of the objective and 
human universe confront us like a mathematical 
problem which carries its solution within itself, 
even though we are not always in a position to solve 
such a problem. We can only decide upon the cor- 
rectness of the solution when we test it in the light 
of the data of the problem. It is a pity that some- 
times the opportunity to test the truth of a solution 
comes so late that there is no time to correct 
mistakes. 

Individuals who do not regard their life’s struc- 
ture from a logical and objective point of view are 
for the most part unable to see the coherence and 
consistency of their behavior pattern. When a prob- 
lem presents itself they are appalled, and instead of 
tackling it they think they have erred in taking a 
road on which they meet problems. In the case of 
children it is also to he remembered that when they 
leave the road of usefulness, they are not in a posi- 
tion to learn positive lessons from negative experi- 
ences simply because they do not understand the sig- 
nificance of problems. It is therefore necessary to 
■ 63 ’ : ■ . 


 
teacli a child to look upon his life, not as a series of 
unconnected events^ but as a continuous thread in- 
terpenetrating all the incidents in his existence. No 
one happening can be taken out from the context of 
his whole life; it can be explained only in relation to 
everything that has gone before. When a child un- 
derstands this he will be able to comprehend why he 
blundered into the wong path. 

Before discussing further the diiference between 
the right and wrong direction for the striving for 
superiority, it may be well to take up the Idnd of be- 
havior which seems to contradict our general theory. 
This is the behavior of laziness — a type of behavior, 
which, on the face of it, seems to contradict the view 
that all children have an innate striving for superior- 
ity. In fact the scolding that a lazy child receives is 
to the effect that he has no striving for superiority, 
that he has no ambition. But if we examine the situa- 
tion of the lazy child more closely, we shall see how 
the ordinary view is mistaken. The lazy child pos- 
sesses certain advantages. He is not burdened with 
other people’s expectations of himself; he is to a cer- 
tain extent excused for not accomplishing so much ; 
he does not struggle, and he therefore assumes a 
negligent, indolent attitude. However, because of 
his laziness he is often successful in pushing himself 


 
into tiie limelight, since his parents find it necessary 
to occupy themselves with him. When w'e consider 
how many children there are who want to have a 
position in the foreground at any price, then we can 
see why some children should hit upon the idea of 
making themselves noticeable by being lazy. 

This, however, is not a complete psychological ex- 
planation of laziness. There are many children who 
adopt a lazy attitude as a means of easing their situ- 
ation. Their apparent incapacity and their lack of 
accomplishment are always attributed to laziness. 
One rarely hears them being accused of incapability; 
on the contrary their families usually say: ‘‘What 
couldn’t he do if he were not lazy?” The children 
content themselves with the recognition that they 
could accomplish everything if only they were not 
lazy. This is balm for the ego of the child who has 
too little confidence in himself. It is a substitute for 
success, not only in the case of children, but for 
adults as well. This fallacious if-sentence, “If I 
were not lazy, what couldn’t I do?” quiets their 
feeling of having failed! When such children really 
do something, their small deed assumes extra sig- 
nificance in their eyes. The one unimportant accom- 
plishment is something of a contrast to their uni- 
form lack of accomplishment before, and as a result 


 
they receive praise for it, while the other cliildreii 
who have always been active receive less recognition 
for greater accomplishments. 

We thus see that there is a hidden and imcompre- 
liended diplomacy in laziness. Lazy children are 
like tigiit-rope w^alkers with a net underneath the 
rope; when they fall, they fall softly. Criticism of 
lazy children is milder than of other children, and 
it insults their ego less. It is less painful to be told 
that one is lazy than that one is incapable. In short 
laziness serves as a screen to hide the child’s lack 
of faith in himself, prohibiting him from making 
attempts to cope with the problems confronting 
him. 

If we consider the current educational methods, 
we shall see that they exactly meet the wishes of the 
lazy child. For the more one scolds a lazj^ child the 
nearer he is to his goal. One occupies oneself with 
him all the time, and the scolding diverts attention 
from the question of his ability, thus fulfilling his 
desire. Punishment works much the same way. 
Teachers who think that they can cure a child of 
laziness by punishing him are always disappointed. 
The severest punishment cannot make an industri- 
ous child out of a lazy one. 

If a transformation takes place it is brought 



 
about by a change in the situation, as, for instance, 
when such a child attains an unexpected success. 
Or again it may happen when he passes from a 
strict teacher to a more gentle one, who under- 
stands the child, talks with him earnestly and gives 
him new courage instead of weakening the little 
courage that he has. In such a situation the change 
from laziness to activity is sometimes surprisingly 
sudden. Thus we have the children who are back- 
ward in the first years of school and who, on com- 
ing to a new school, show themselves unusually 
industrious because of the change of school environ- 
ment. 

Some children who do not seek escape by means 
of laziness avoid useful activity by playing sick. 
Other children are unusually excited at examina- 
tion time because they have a feeling they will be 
shown some preference on account of their nervous 
tension. The same psychological tendency is mani- 
fested by children who cry: the crying and the ex- 
citement are pleas for privilege. 

In the same class with these children are also to 
be put the children who, on the basis of some defect, 
demand special consideration — for example the 
stutterers. Those who have had much to do with 
tiny children wail have noticed that ahnost all chil- 
■ ■ 67 


 
dren show a faint tendency to stutter when they 
begin to speak. The development of speech is, as 
we know, quickened and retarded by many factors, 
principally by the degree of social feeling. Children 
who are socially-minded, who want to make con- 
tact with their fellow human beings will learn to 
speak much more quickly and easily than those who 
avoid others. There are even situations in which 
speech is a superfluous activity ; for example, in the 
case of a child so protected and pampered that his 
every wish is divined and fulfilled before he has 
time to make his desires known (as is necessarily 
done with children who are deaf mutes) . 

When children do not learn to speak before they 
are four or five the parents begin to be afraid of 
deaf -mutism. But they soon notice that they are 
able to hear quite well, which of course excludes the 
hypothesis of deaf-miitism. On the other hand it is 
observed that they are really living in an environ- 
ment in which speech is superfluous. When every- 
thing is handed to a child “on a silver platter,” as 
we say, so that he has no urge to speak, then the 
child will learn to speak very late in life. Speech is 
an indication of the child’s striving for superiority 
and of the direction of its development. He must 
speak in order to express his superiority striving, 



 
whether this expression takes the form of bringing 
joy to Ills family by his utterances or whether it 
takes the form of helping him attain his ordinarj^ 
needs. When there is no possibilitj^ for this type of 
expression in either form, then we can naturally 
expect difficulties in the way of speech develop- 
ment. 

There are other speech defects, such as difficulty 
in the pronunciation of certain consonants, like r, k 
and s. They are all curable, and it is therefore 
rather remarkable that there should he so many 
adults who stutter, lisp or speak unintelligibly. 

Most children grow out of stuttering. A small 
percentage must be treated. What is involved in 
the process of treatment may be illustrated from 
the case of a thirteen-year-old boy. A doctor started 
to treat this boy when he was six years old. The 
treatment lasted a year and was unsuccessful. A 
year followed without professional assistance, then 
another year with another doctor, the treatment 
being again unsuccessful^ The fourth year nothing 
was done, and during the first two months of the 
fifth year he was entrusted to a speech doctor who 
made his condition worse. Some time later he was 
sent to an institute specializing in speech defects, 
I’lie treatment, which lasted two months, was sue- 


 
cessfiil, but after a period of six months there was 
a relapse. 

There followed eight months at the hands of still 
another speech doctor. This time, instead of any 
improvement being noticed, a gradual deteriora" 
tion set in. One more doctor was tried but again 
without success. During the next summer he im- 
proved, but at the end of the vacation period he 
sank back into his old manner of speaking. 

Most of the treatment consisted in having the 
boy read aloud, in slow speaking, exercises, etc. It 
was remarked that some forms of excitement pro- 
duced temporary improvement, only to be followed 
by relapse. The boy had no organic defects, al- 
though as a tiny child he had suffered a fall from 
the second story of a building, which resulted in 
concussion of the brain. 

The boy’s teacher, who had known him for a 
year, described him as ‘'a well-bred, industrious lad 
who blushes easily and is somewhat irritable.” 
French and geography were the boy’s hardest sub- 
jects, he said. At examination time he was specially 
excited. Of his special interests the teacher noted a 
taste for gymnastics and sports and also a liking for 
technical work. The boy did not manifest in any 
way the nature of a leader; he got along well with 
TO 



 
liis schoolmates, but quarrelled occasionally with his 
younger brother. He was left-handed, and the year 
before he had had a stroke of facial paralysis on the 
right side of his face. 

Turning to his family environment, we find the 
father to be a business man, who is very nervous 
and who often scolds the son severely when he stut- 
ters. Despite this the boy has more fear of his 
mother. He has a tutor at home, and as a result he 
can seldom leave the house. He rather misses his 
lack of freedom. ITe also thinks his mother is un- 
fair because she favors the younger boy. 

On the basis of these facts the following explana- 
tion may be offered : The boy’s ready blushing is an 
indication of the increase in tension which comes as 
soon as he must make a social contact. It is, as it 
were, a relative of his stuttering habit. Even a 
teacher whom he likes does not succeed in curing 
him of his stuttering because this stuttering has be- 
come mechanized into his system and expresses his 
general dislike for others. 

We know that the motive for stuttering does not 
lie in the external environment but in the way the 
stutterer apperceives that environment. His irrita- 
bility is psychologically very significant. He is not 
a passive child. His striving for recognition and 


 
superiority expresses itself in irritability, as it does 
with most weak natures. Another proof of his dis- 
couragement is revealed by the fact that he quar- 
rels only with a younger boy. His excitement be- 
fore an examination shows his increased tension due 
to the fear that he will not be successful and the 
feeling that he is not as capable as others. He has a 
strong feeling of inferiority, which diverts his 
striving for superiority in a useless direction. 

Inasmuch as the situation at home is not as agree- 
able as at school, the boy gladly goes to school. At 
home the younger brother occupies the center of the 
stage. It is impossible that an organic wound or 
fright should have been the cause of his stuttering, 
but one or the other may have helped rob him of his 
courage. His younger brother, who has pushed him 
to one side in the family constellation, has had a 
greater effect upon him. 

It is also significant that the boy suffered from 
enuresis (bed-wetting) until he was eight years 
old, a symptom found for the most j^art only in 
those children who were first spoiled and pampered 
and later ‘"dethroned,” The bed-wetting is a sure 
indication that he fought for his mother’s attention 
even at night. It is a sign in this case that the child 
could not reconcile himself to being left alone. 




 

The boy can be cured through encouragement 
and through being taught how to he independent. 
One must put tasks in his way which he can accom- 
plish, and from the accomplishment of which he can 
gain faith in himself. The boy admits that the ar- 
rival of his younger brother was disagreeable to 
him: he must now be made to understand how his 
jealousy has driven him into a false turn. 

There is much to be said about the symptoms 
which accompany stuttering. Thus we want to 
know what happens in a state of excitement. Many 
stutterers when they become angry can scold with- 
out a trace of stuttering showing in their speech. 
Also older stutterers frequently speak flawlessly 
when reciting, or when they are in love. These are 
the facts that indicate that the decisive factor lies in 
their relation to others. The decisive moment is the 
confrontation, the tension aroused in the child when 
he must establish a connection between himself and 
another, or when he must achieve expression by 
means of speech. 

When a child learns to speak without undue dif- 
ficulty no one pays much attention to the progress 
of his speech; but when a child shows difficulties, 
nothing else is mentioned in the house and the stut- 
terer occupies the center of attention. The family 


 
occupies itself exclusively with the child, and the 
result is of course that the child pays too much at» 
tention to his speech. He begins consciously to con- 
trol his expression^ something that children who 
speak normally do not do. We know that the con- 
scious control of functions which should operate 
automatically results in a restriction of the func- 
tion. A pretty example of this is given by Meyriiik 
in his fairy tale, ‘‘The Flight of the Toad.” The 
toad meets an animal with a thousand feet and im- 
mediately begins praising the powers of this re- 
markable animal. “Can you tell me,” asks the toad, 
“which one of your thousand legs you move first, 
and in what order you move the other nine hundred 
and ninety-nine legs?” The millipede begins to 
think and starts observing the movements of his 
legs, and in his attempts to control them he becomes 
confused and cannot move a single one. 

Important as it is to exercise conscious control 
on the course of our life, it is harmful to attempt to 
control each individual movement. We are able to 
produce works of art only when we can automatize 
the physical movements necessary to produce these 
works. 

Despite the disastrous effect which the stuttering 
habit has on the future possibilities of the child and 


 
despite the obvious disadvantages that accompany 
the stuttering during the bringing up of the child 
(the sympathy and the special attention given him 
by liis family), there are still many persons who 
take refuge in excuses rather than to seek to im- 
prove the condition. This applies both to parents 
and to children, both of whom may have no faith in 
the future. The child especially is content to lean 
on others and to maintain an advantage by a seem- 
ing disadvantage. 

How frequently apparent disadvantages may be 
turned to advantage is illustrated in one of Balzac’s 
stories. He tells of two tradesmen who tried to get 
the best of each other in a bargain. While they were 
thus bargaining one of them began to stutter. The 
other one noticed, quite surprised, that the stutterer 
by his stuttering won time enough to think before 
making his point. He searched quickly for a coun- 
ter-weapon, and suddenly he made himself unable 
to hear any more. The stutterer was then at a dis- 
advantage, inasmuch as he had to strain himself in 
* 

order to make the other one hear. Equality was 
thereby re-established. 

Stutterers should not be handled like criminals 
even though they sometimes use this mechanism in 
order to win time for themselves or make others 


 

wait. Children who stutter should be encouraged 
and should be treated gently. Only through friendly 
enlightenment and through increasing the courage 
of the child can successful cures be accomphshed.
