CHAPTER EIGHT 


THE CHILD’S POSITION IN THE FAMILY: 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TPIE SITUATION AND 
THE REMEDY 

W E have seen that children develop in ac- 
cordance with their unconscious inter- 
pretation of the position they occupy in relation 
to their environment. We have also seen that first, 
second and third children develop differently, each 
in accordance with his particular position in the 
family constellation. This early condition may be 
regarded as a test of the character developed by 
the child. 

The education of a child cannot begin too soon. 
As a child grows he develops a certain set of rules 
or formulas which regulate his conduct and deter- 
mine his reactions to various situations. When a 
child is very young there are only slight indications 
of the particular mechanism he is constructing to 
guide his future behavior. Later on, as the result of 
years of training, this behavior pattern becomes 


 
fixed and he no longer reacts objectively but in ac- 
cordance with Ms unconscioiis interpretation of 
the sum total of Ms. past experiences*, W'hen a child 
has made a false interpretation of any particular 
situation or of Ills own ability to cope with a par- 
ticular difficulty, this erroneous judgment ivill 
determine his conduct and no amount of logic or 
common sense can change the adult conduct until 
the original, childish misinterpretation is corrected. 

There is always something subjective in the de- 
velopment of a child and it is this individuality 
which pedagogues must investigate. It is this in- 
dividuality which prevents the application of gen- 
eral rules in the education of groups of children. 
This is also the reason why the application of the 
same rule results differently with different chil- 
dren. 

On the other hand when we see children reacting 
to the same situation in almost the same way we 
cannot say that this is because of a law of nature ; 
what is true is that human beings are prone to make 
the same mistakes because of their common lack of 
understanding. It is customarily believed that a 
child always becomes jealous when another child 
appears in the family. One objection to this gen- 
eralization is that there are exceptions; another, 


 
that a knovHedge of liow to prepare children for 
the arrival of a younger brother or sister would 
make jealousy impossible. A child who makes a 
mistake may be compared to a person who finds 
himself in the mountains in front of a footpath. He 
does not know where or how to proceed. When he 
has finally found the right path and has come to 
the next town, he hears people say in astonishment : 
“illmost everyone who wanders off that path gets 
lost.” Mistakes made by children are often along 
such enticing paths. They look easy to tread, and 
thus attract the child. 

There are many other situations which have im- 
measurable influences upon the character of a 
child. How often do we see two children in a fam- 
ily, one who is good and one who is bad? If we in- 
vestigate the circumstances a little more closely, 
we find that the bad child has an intense desire for 
superiority, wants to dominate all the others and 
uses all his power to rule the environment. The 
house is noisy with his cries. The other child, by 
way of contrast, is quiet, modest, the family’s 
favorite, and held forth as an example to the other. 
The parents do not know how to explain such op- 
posites in the same family. Upon examination we 
see that the good child has discovered that he is able 


 
to gain much more recognition liis excellent be- 
havior and competes successfully with Ills bad 
brother or sister, as the case may he. It is under- 
standable that when there is a rivaliy of this nature 
between two children the first child has no hope of 
surpassing the second by being better than the sec- 
ond, and so he strives to excel him in the opposite 
direction, that is to say, by being as naughty as 
possible. It has been our experience that such 
naughty children can be turned into even better 
children than their brothers and sisters. It is also 
our experience that a strong desire for superiority 
may express itself in one extreme direction or the 
other. We see the same thing in school. 

It is impossible to predict that two children will 
be exactly the same because they grow up under 
the same conditions. No two children grow up 
under exactly the same conditions. The character 
of a weli-hehaved child is greatly influenced by the 
presence of an ill-behaved one. As a matter of fact, 
there are many children who were originally well- 
behaved and who afterwards turned into problem 
children. 

There is the case of a seventeen-year old girl 
who was a model child up to the time she was ten 
years old. She had a brother eleven years older who 



THE EDUCATIOx^ OF CHILDREN 
had been badly spoiled because be bad been the 
only child for eleven years. The boy was not 
jealous of bis sister when she arrived; be merely 
continued his usual behavior. When the little girl 
reached her tenth year the brother began to be 
away from home for long periods. She assumed 
the position of an only child, and this situation had 
the effect of making her want to have her own way 
at any price. She grew up in a rich home, so that 
when she was a child it was easy to fuldll her 
every desire. When she grew older this was not 
always possible and she began to show her dissatis- 
faction. She commenced to incur debts at an early 
age on the strength of her family’s financial repu- 
tation, and in a short time she owed a considerable 
sum of money. This means nothing more than that 
she chose another road to fulfill her wishes. Her 
good behavior vanished when her mother refused 
to accede to her demands. There were quarrels, 
tears and the girl developed into a most unpleasant 
cliaracter. 

The general conclusion to be drawn from this 
case and other cases resembling it, is that a child 
can satisfy his superiority striving by good be- 
havior and that we are therefore never sure 


 
wlietlier sucli good behavior will continue when 
there is a change in the situation.. The advantage 
of our psychological questionnaire is that it gives 
us a more comprehensive picture of the child and 
his activities, as well as his relation to his environ- 
ment and to all its members. There will always be 
certain indications of his style of life, and when we 
have studied the child and the information gained 
from the questionnaire we will find that his char» 
acter traits, emotions and style of life are all tools 
used by him to promote his striving for superiority, 
increase his feeling of importance and obtain pres- 
tige in his world. 

There is a type of child frequently met with in 
school who seems to contradict this description® 
This is the indolent child who is reserved, im- 
pervious to knowledge, discipline, or correction, 
who lives in a world of his own fantasy, and at no 
time displaying a striving for superiority. With 
enough experience, however, it is possible to per- 
ceive that this is also a form of striving, even 
thougli an absurd one. Such a child has no faith 
in his ability to achieve success by the usual means, 
and as a result he avoids all means and opportuni- 
ties for improvement. He isolates himself and gives 
the impression of a hardened character. This hard- 



 
ness, liowever, does not include his whole person- 
ality; behind it one usually can find an extraordi- 
narily sensitive, trembling spirit which needs this 
outer callousness to protect itself from hurt. He 
encloses himself in an armor and nothing can come 
near him. 

IVhen one succeeds in finding a way to induce 
this type to speak, one finds that he is very much 
occupied with himself, daydreams constantly and 
creates fantasies in which he always appears great 
or superior. Reality is far from the daydreams of 
such children. They make believe that they are 
heroes, conquering all others ; or tyrants who have 
robbed all others of power ; or martyrs helping the 
suffering. The inclination to play the savior is to 
be found frequently among children, not only in 
their daydreaming hut in their actions. There are 
children who can be depended upon to spring to 
the rescue when another is in danger. Children who 
played the role of rescuer in their daydreams train 
themselves for the part in reality and, when not too 
discouraged, act the part when the opportunity 
offers. 

Certain daydreams recur continually. In Austria 
during the time of the monarchy there were many 
children who had daydreams of saving the king 


i ’ 






 
or one of the princes from danger. The parents, of 
course, never know that their children have such 
ideas. All that is to be seen is that children who day- 
dream a lot cannot adjust themselves to reality and 
are unable to make themselves useful. In such cases 
there is a wide gap between fantasy and reality. 
Children sometimes choose the middle road; they 
retain their daydreaming while making a partial 
adjustment to reality. Others make no adjustment 
at ail and withdraw more and more from the world 
into a private world of their own creation, while 
still others want to have nothing to do with prod“ 
ucts of the imagination and occupy themselves 
only with reality — stories of travel, or of hunting, 
history, efcc. 

There is no doubt that a child should have some 
imagination as well as a willingness to accept 
reality, but we must not forget that children do 
not regard these things as simply as we do and are 
prone to divide the world sharply into two ex- 
tremes. A most important fact which should be 
borne in mind in imderstanding children is that 
they have a strong tendency to divide everything 
into opposites (above or below, all good or all 
bad, clever or stupid, superior or inferior, all or 
nothing). Adults also use this same antithetic 


 
sclieme of apperception. It is well known that it is 
difficult to rid ourselves of this manner of think- 
ing; for instance, to regard hot and cold as op- 
posites when we know scientifically that the only 
difference is a difference in degree of temperature. 
Not only do we find this antithetic scheme of ap- 
perception very frequently among children hut we 
also find it in the beginnings of philosophical 
science. The early days of Greek philosophy are 
dominated by this idea of opposites. Even to-day 
almost every amateur philosopher tries to measure 
values by means of opposites. Some of them have 
even established tables — ^life-death, above-below, 
and finally, man-woman. There is a significant 
similarity between the present childish and the old 
philosophic scheme of apperception, and we may as- 
sume that those people who are accustomed to 
divide the world into sharp contrasts have retained 
their childish way of thinking. 

People who live according to such an antithetic 
device have a formula which can be expressed by 
the maxim “all or nothing.” Of course it is impos- 
sible to realize such an ideal in this world, but none- 
theless they regulate their lives according to it. It 
is impossible for human beings to have either all or 
nothing. There are a thousand and one gradations 
U5 


 
between these tw^o extremes. Tliis formula is to be 
found principally among those children w4o have a 
deep feeling of inferiority and who become inordi- 
nately ambitious as a compensation. There are 
several such characters to be found in history, for 
example, Caesar, who was murdered by his friends 
when he sought for the crovm. Many of the pecu- 
liarities and character traits of children can be 
traced to this idea of all or nothing — for example, 
stubbornness. There are so many proofs of this to 
be found in the lives of children that we have been 
led to conclude that such children have developed 
a private philosophy, or a private intelligence con- 
trary to common sense. As an illustration we may 
cite the case of a four-year-old girl who was un- 
usually stubborn and perverse. One day her 
mother brought her an orange and the child took 
it, threw it on the floor and said : ‘T don’t want it 
when you bring it; I’ll have it when I feel like hav- 
ing it I” 

Indolent children who 0amiot have everything 
withdraw more and more into the emptiness of 
their daydreams, fantasies and castles-in-the-air. 
It must not be too quickly assumed, however, that 
such children are lost. We know very well that 
hypersensitive natures easily mthdraw’' from 


 
reality since their personally created world of fan- 
tasy promises them a certain protection from 
further wounding. But this withdrawal does not 
necessarily bespeak compiete maladjustment or 
unadaptability. A certain distance from reality is 
necessary not only for writers and artists but even 
for scientists, who also need a good imagination. 
The fantasies evoked in daydreams are nothing 
more nor less than a detour which an individual at- 
tempts to take to avoid the tmpleasantnesses and 
possible failures in life. We must not forget that 
just those people who had rich imaginations and 
who were later able to combine their fantasies with 
reality became the leaders of mankind. They be- 
came leaders not only because of a better school- 
ing, keener observation, but also because of their 
courage and the consciousness with which they ap- 
proached the difficulties of life and successfully 
fought them. The biographies of great men often 
reveal that while they did not have much use for 
reality and were bad students as children, they did 
develop a remarkable ability to observe what went 
on around them; so that as soon as conditions be- 
came more favorable their courage grew to the 
point w^here they once more approached reality 
and took up the fight. Naturally, there is no rule 



THE EDUCATION 0¥ CHILDREN 
as to how to make great men out of children. How- 
ever, it is well to remember that we must never ap- 
proach children brusquely, we must always en- 
courage them, always try to explain to them the 
sigmficance of real life so that they do not create a 
chasm between their fantasies and the world.
