CHAPTER FIVE 


THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX 

T he striving for superiority and the sense of 
inferiority go together in every human being. 
We strive because we feel inferior, and we overcome 
our feeling of inferiority by successful striving. The 
sense of inferiority does not, however, become psy- 
chologically significant unless either the mechanism 
of successful striving is obstructed or unless it is in- 
creased beyond endurance by the psychological re- 
action to organ inferiority. Then we have an 
inferiority complex — an abnormal sentiment of in- 
feriority which necessarily seeks easy compensations 
and specious satisfactions and which at the same time 
obstructs the road to successful accomplishment by 
magnifying the obstacles and decreasing the supply 
of courage. 

Let us consider again in this connection the case 
of the thirteen-year-old boy who stuttered. His dis- 
couragement is, as we have seen, partly responsible 
for his continued stuttering, and his stuttering in- 


 
creases liis discouragement. We thus have here tlie 
usual vicious circle of a neurotic inferiority complex. 
The boy wants to hide himself. He has given up 
hope ; he may even have had thoughts of suicide. The 
boy’s stuttering has become an expression and a con- 
tinuation of his life’s pattern. It makes an impress 
sion upon his environment, it puts him in the center 
of attention, and thus eases his psychological ma- 
laise. 

The boy has set before himself a somewhat over- 
valued and mistaken goal of counting in the world 
and amounting to something. He will always strive 
for prestige, and he must therefore show himself to 
be good-natured, to be able to get along with others, 
to have his work in order. On top of that he feels he 
must have an alibi in case he experiences a defeat, 
and this alibi is bis stuttering. The case of this boy 
is thus ail the more significant because for the most 
part his life is usefully oriented; it is only in one 
phase that his judgment and his courage have de- 
teriorated. 

Stuttering is of course only one of innumerable 
weapons which discouraged children use when they 
do not believe that they will be able to succeed on the 
strength of their own ability. These weapons of dis- 
couragement may be compared to the weapons 


 
which nature has given animals for their protection 
• — claws and horns. It is easy to see how they have 
their origin in the child’s weakness, and his despair 
of being able to cope with life without such extrane- 
ous equipment. And it is remarkable how many 
things may serve for such weapons. There are some 
children who have no other weapon than their lack 
of control of stools and urine. It is an indication that 
they do not want to leave their infancy, the state in 
which one can live mthout work and pain. There is 
seldom any organic weakness of the intestines or 
the bladder in the case of such children. They merely 
resort to these things as tricks which will awaken the 
sympathy of the parent or educator — ^and this de- 
spite the fact that the same tricks may sometimes 
evoke ridicule from their comrades. Such manifesta- 
tions should therefore not be treated as sicknesses 
but as expressions of an inferiority complex, or of 
an endangered striving for superiority. 

We can visualize how the stuttering complaint 
developed, probably out pf a very small physiological 
core. The boy was an only child for a long time, and 
his mother was constantly occupied with him. As he 
grew up he probably felt that he was not receiving 
enough attention, that his expression was being cur- 
tailed, and so he discovered a new trick with which 
■. . 79 


 
to draw attention to himself. Stuttering assumed a 
greater significance; he noticed hov/ the person to 
whom he spoke watched his mouth. By stuttering lie 
was thus able to secure for himself some of the time 
and attention that would otherwise have been de- 
voted to the younger brother. 

It was not otherwise in school. He found a teacher 
who devoted much time to him. Thus as a result 
of his stuttering he was able to assume a role of 
superiority both at home and at school. He missed 
none of the popularity which falls to the lot of good 
students and for which he yearned. He doubtless was 
a good student, but in any case things were made 
easier for him. 

On the other hand, though his stuttering had the 
effect of inducing his teacher to be lenient with liim, 
it is scarcely a method to be recommended. The boy 
is hurt much more than other children when he fails 
to receive what he considers his quota of attention. 
This securing of attention became in fact a sore sub- 
ject with the appearance of the younger brother in 
the family constellation. Unlike normal children lie 
never developed the ability to spread his interest to 
others : he made his mother the most important per- 
son in his family environment, to the exclusion of 
everybody else. 




THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 
One must begin the treatment of such children by- 
increasing their courage and by getting them to be- 
lieve in their own strength and ability. Valuable as 
it is to establish friendly relations with such children 
by means of a sympathetic attitude and not to 
frighten them by stern measures, this is still not 
enough. The friendly relation must be used to en- 
courage the children to make continued improve- 
ment. This can be done only by making the children 
more independent, by bringing them — through vari- 
ous devices — to the point where they necessarily ac- 
quire faith in their own mental and physical powers. 
They simply must be convinced that what they have 
not yet achieved can be readily attained by industry, 
perseverance, practice and courage. 

The worst mistake in  is 
for the parent or educator to prophesy a bad end- 
ing for a child who has strayed on the wrong path. 
Such a stupid prophecy makes the situation in- 
finitely worse since it increases the child’s coward- 
ice. One should do just the opposite: inspire the 
child with optimism. As Virgil said, “they can be- 
cause they think they can.” 

It must never be believed that we can influence a 
child to really improve his conduct by humiliating 
him or shaming him, even though we sometimes see 


 
that cliildren who are afraid of being laughed at seem 
to change their behavior. How unsound is this stimu- 
lation by ridicule may be judged from the following 
case. There was a boy who was constantly being 
teased by his friends because he was not able to swim. 
Finally he could stand the ridicule no longer, and so 
he jumped from the diving board into deep water. 
He was saved from drowning only with great diffi- 
culty. It may be that a coward who is in danger of 
losing his prestige does something to counteract his 
cowardice, but it is seldom the proper act. It is often 
a cowardly, useless way of meeting his original 
cowardice, as we see from the case just cited. The 
real cowardice lay in the fact that the boy was afraid 
to admit that he could not swim because he would 
thereby lose standing among his friends. He did not 
cure that cowardice by desperately jumping into the 
water, but rather reinforced his cowardly propensity 
not to face facts. 

Cowardice is a trait which always destroys human 
relations. A child who is always so worried about his 
own person that he can no longer consider others is 
willing to achieve prestige at the cost of his fellow 
human beings. Cowardice thus brings in its wake an 
individualistic, combative attitude which abolishes 
social feeling, although it is far from abolishing the 



 
fear of others' opinions. A coY^ard is always afraid 
of being ridiculed by people, of being overlooked, or 
being degraded. He is thus always at the mercy of 
of the opinions of others. He is like a person living 
in an enemy country, and he develops the character 
traits of suspicion, envy and selfishness. 

Children of this cowardly type frequently become 
critical and nagging persons, reluctant to praise 
others and resentful if others are praised. It is thus 
a sign of weakness when one wants to surpass others 
not through one’s own accomplishments but through 
degrading the others. To rid children of inimical feel- 
ings towards others is a pedagogical task which can- 
not be avoided by those who have recognized the 
symptoms. He who does not see it is, of course, ex- 
cused, but be will never know how to correct the 
resulting unfavorable character traits. But when 
we know that the problem is to reconcile the child to 
the world and to life, to show him his mistake and to 
explain to him that what he wanted was to have the 
prize of prestige without having worked to achieve 
it, then we also know in what direction to work upon 
the child. We know that we have to strengthen the 
friendly feelings that children should have for one 
another. We know that we also have to teach chil- 
dren not to look down upon another because he has 


 
received a bad mark or because lie lias done soine- 
tliing wrong. Otherwise they build up an inferiority 
complex and they rob the child of his courage. 

When a child is robbed of his faith in the future^ 
the result is that he withdraws from reality and 
builds up a compensatory striving on the useless 
side of life. An educator’s most important task — 
one might almost say his holy duty — is to see to it 
that no child is discouraged at school, and that a 
child who enters school already discouraged regains 
his conddence in himself through his school and his 
teacher. This goes hand in hand with the vocation 
of the educator, for no education is possible except 
with children who look hopefully and joyfully upon 
the future. 

There is a type of discouragement which is only 
temporary, and occurs particularly in the case of 
ambitious children who, despite the progress they 
are making, sometimes lose hope because they have 
passed their last examination and must now turn to 
the choice of an occupation. Also some ambitious 
children often give up the fight for a while, when 
they do not achieve first rank in their examinations. 
The conflict which unconsciously has been long in 
preparation suddenly breaks out. It may express 
itself in complete confusion, or in anxiety neur- 



 
osis. Such cliildren. — if their discouragement is not 
checked in time — will always be starting something 
without finishing it; and -when they are older they 
will change their jobs frequently, never believing 
that anything can end well for them and always fear- 
ing defeat. 

The self-evaluation of a child is then of the great- 
est importance. It is impossible, however, to discover 
what a child really thinks of himself by asking him. 
No matter how diplomatically we go about it we re- 
ceive uncertain or indefinite answers. Some children 
will say that they think rather well of themselves ; 
other children will say that they are worth nothing. 
Investigation in the latter cases may often disclose 
that the adults in their environment have said to 
them hundreds of times, “You aren’t wwth any- 
thing!” or “You are stupid!” 

There are few children who can hear so scathing 
a reproach without being wounded by it. There are 
others, however, who protect and shield their ego by 
undervaluing their ability. 

If questioning a child does not inform us as to 
his judgment of himself, we can, however, observe 
the manner in which he approaches his problem — 
whether, for example, he goes forward in a confi- 
dent, decided manner, or whether he exhibits the sign 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDBEN 
that is to be found most frequently among dis» 
couraged children, a hesitating manner. Sctiemati- 
cally this may be illustrated by the example of a 
child who starts to go bravely forward, but who 
slows down and falters the nearer he approaches Ills 
tasks and finally stops altogether at some distance 
before actual contact with them. Sometimes such 
children are described as lazy, sometimes as absent- 
minded. The descriptions may be different ; the re- 
sult is always the same. The children do not tackle 
their work as we expect a normal human being to 
do, but are always occupied with obstacles. Some- 
times a child is so successful in fooling his elders that 
they fall into the mistake of thinking him lacking in 
ability. When we keep the whole picture in mind and 
illuminate it by the principles of Individual Psy- 
chology we find that the whole trouble has been the 
lack of confidence — undervaluation. 

When we consider a misdirected striving for su- 
periority we must remember that a completely self- 
centered individual is an anomaly in society. One 
often sees children who, because of an inordinate 
superiority striving, are without consideration for 
any one else. They are inimical, lawbreaking, greedy 
and selfish. When they discover a secret they will 
always use it to hurt some one else. 




 

But in those children whose conduct is most rep- 
rehensible we find a trait which is unmistakably hu- 
man ; somewhere or other they have a feeling of be- 
longing to mankind. The relation of their ego to the 
world around them is implied or expressed in some 
way although the further their life’s scheme is from 
the conception of co-operation, the more difficult it 
is to discover any social feeling. We must look for 
forms of expression which betray the hidden feeling 
of inferiority. These expressions are innumerable. 
They begin with the glance of a child. The eye is not 
only an organ which takes up rays and conducts 
them further but also an organ for social conununi- 
cation. The way a person looks at another shows the 
degree of his inclination to connect himself with the 
other. That is why all psychologists and writers have 
stressed so much the glance of a human being. We 
all judge another person’s opinion of us by the way 
he looks at us and we try to discover a part of his 
soul in his glance. Even though it is possible to make 
mistakes or to misinterpret, it is somewhat easier to 
conclude from the glance of a child whether he is a 
friendly human being. 

It is well Imown that those children who cannot 
look adults directly in the face open themselves to 
suspicion. These are not always children with a bad 


 
conscience or children with the habit of sexual mat 
practice. This glancing away may simply indicate 
an attempt to avoid tying himself, however momen- 
tarily, to another human being. It indicates the 
child’s attempt to withdraw from the society of his 
comrades. How near a child approaches you vdien 
you call him is also an indication. Many children 
remain at some distance, they want to find out first 
what it is all about and will approach only when it 
is necessary. They regard close contact with sus- 
picion because they have had some bad experiences 
and have generalized their one-sided knowledge and 
so misused it. It is also interesting to observe the ten- 
dency of some children to lean, either on the mother 
or on the teacher. The one to whom a child goes more 
willingly is much more important than the one whom 
he says he loves most. 

There are children who reveal a distinct feeling of 
confidence and courage in the way they walk, in their 
erect carriage and well-carried head, in their firm 
voice and lack of timidity. Other children shrink 
when they are spoken to and immediately betray 
their feeling of inferiority, their fear of not being 
able to cope with the situation. 

In investigating this inferiority complex we find 
many who believe that it is innate. The objection to 



 
this opiriion is that any child, no matter how coura- 
geous, can be made afraid. A child whose father and 
mother are timid will probably be timid as well, not 
because he has inherited the timidity but because he 
has gro’ivn up in an atmosphere permeated with 
fear. The atmosphere of the family, and the char- 
acter traits of the parents are most important in the 
development of a child. Children who keep to them- 
selves in school come more often than not from fam- 
ilies having little or no relations with others. It is of 
course a temptation to think of inherited character- 
istics in such cases, but this is an exploded theory. 
No physical changes in the organs or in the brain are 
able to produce an inability to make contact with 
others. There are, however, facts which do not neces- 
sarily compel such an attitude but which make un- 
derstandable the appearance of such a peculiarity. 

The simplest case which will enable us to under- 
stand the matter theoretically is the example of a 
child born with weak organs, who has been sickly 
for some time, and oppressed by life because of pain 
and weakness. Such children are very much occu- 
pied with themselves and look upon the outer world 
as hard and hostile. A second harmful factor plays a 
role in such cases. A weak child must find a person 
who makes life easier for him, who devotes himself 


 
to the child, and who by this very devotion and pro- 
tective attitude develops in the child a strong feel- 
ing of inferiority. All children, because of the dis- 
parity in size and strength between them and adults, 
have a relative feeling of inferiority. This feeling of 
being “less” is easily intensified when a child is told, 
as so frequently happens, “Children should be seen 
and not heard.” 

All these impressions sharpen the child’s percep- 
tion of the fact that he is in a disadvantageous posi- 
tion. The realization that he is smaller and less 
powerful than others is one with which he finds it 
impossible to reconcile himself. The more the idea 
that he is smaller and weaker stings him, the greater 
the efforts that he will make to become more. His 
striving for recognition has received an added im- 
petus. Instead of trying to arrange his life so that it 
harmonizes with the lives of those in his immediate 
surroundings, he creates a new formula, “Think 
only of yourself.” That is a type of child which keeps 
to himself. 

It may he safely stated that the majority of weak, 
crippled and ugly children have a strong feeling of 
inferiority, which expresses itself in two extremes. 
Either they shrink when spoken to, withdraw, are 


 
timid, or they are aggressive. Those are two forms 
of behavior which seem to be totally apart but which 
may be identified by the same cause. In their striv- 
ing for recognition such children betray themselves 
by saying too little one time and too much another. 
Their social feeling is either ineffectual because they 
expect nothing from life and believe that they are 
able to give nothing, or because they subvert the 
feeling to personal use. They want to be leaders and 
heroes, always in the center. 

When a child has been training himself in a wrong 
direction for years, it is impossible to expect that a 
single conversation will change his pattern. The edu- 
cator must have patience. In such cases where the 
children make attempts to improve and have an oc- 
casional relapse, it is sometimes advisable to explain 
to the child that improvement does not come quickly. 
This quiets the child and does not permit him to be 
discouraged. When a child has been deficient in 
mathematics for two years he cannot possibly make 
up the deficiency in two weeks, but that he can make 
it up is indisputable. A normal child, that is to say, 
a courageous one, is capable of making up anything. 
We see again and again that an inability is due to a 
mistaken development, a peculiar, heavy, graceless 


 
formation of the whole personality. It is always pos- 
sible to help behavior-problem cliildren who are not 
feeble-minded. 

Inability or seeming stupidity, clumsiness, apathy 
are not sufficient proof of feeble-imndedness. With 
feeble-minded children there are always physical in- 
dications of faulty brain development. This bodily 
defect may be caused by those glands which affect 
the development of the brain. Sometimes such physi- 
cal defects vanish in the course of time, and what re- 
main are only the psychic traces of the original 
physical deficiency. That is to say, a child who was 
originally weak because of a weak organism may 
continue to act as if he were weak even after his body 
has grown strong. 

We must even go further. Not only may psycho- 
logical inferioritj^ and an egocentric attitude be the 
result of the past history of organic inferiority and 
physical weakness, but they may also be brought 
about by entirely different circumstances that have 
nothing to do with organic inferiority. They may be 
brought about tlirough the wrong kind of nourish- 
ment, or through a loveless and harsh upbringing. 
In such cases, life for the child becomes only a mis- 
ery, and the child assumes a hostile attitude towai-ds 


 
his environment. The effects are similar, if not iden- ■ 
tical, with the disturbance in psychological life re- 
suiting from organic inferiority. 

We have to expect that we shall have great diffi- 
culties in treating those children who have been 
brought up in an atmosphere devoid of love. They 
mil look upon us as they look upon all others who 
hurt them ; every urge to go to school will be felt as 
oppression. They will always feel fettered and will 
always have the tendency to revolt as far as lies in 
their power. They will not be able to assume a correct 
attitude towards their comrades because they envy 
those children who have had a happier childhood. 

Such embittered children often develop into char- 
acters who like to poison the life of others. They have 
not been sufficiently courageous to overcome their 
environment and they try to compensate for their 
own feeling of lack of power by oppressing those 
who are weaker, or by being superior to others 
through an apparent friendliness. This friendliness, 
however, lasts only as long as the others permit 
themselves to be dominated. Many children come to 
the point where they make friends only with those 
who are in worse circumstances, just as there are 
adults who feel themselves particularly drawn to 



 
sufferers. Or they prefer younger, poorer cliildreri. 
Boys, too, sometimes prefer a particularly gentle, 
submissive type of girl, without sex entering into 
their preference. 



CHAPTEE, SIX 


THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD: PRE- 
VENTING THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX 

W HEN a child takes an unusually long 
time to learn to walk, but can walk nor- 
mally once he has learned, it does not mean that 
the child must develop an inferiority complex for 
the rest of his life. We know, however, that a 
child whose mental development is otherwise nor- 
mal is always strongly impressed by any restric- 
tion in the freedom of movement. He feels that 
his situation is an unhappy one and he is likely to 
draw pessimistic conclusions from it, which may 
tend to govern his future course of action, even 
though the original physical, functional incapacity 
disappears later. There are many children who at 
at one time had rickets and who, though cured, 
still bear the marks of the disease; crooked legs, 
clumsiness, lung catarrh, a certain malformation 
of the head (caput quadratum), curved spine, en- 
larged ankles, feeble joints, bad posture, etc. 


 
Wliat remains psychically is the feeling of defeat 
which they acquired during their illness, and their 
consequent inclination to pessimism. Such chih 
dreii see the ease with which their comrades carry 
on and are oppressed by a feeling of inferiority. 
They undervalue themselves, and take one of two 
courses. Either they completely lose confidence 
and make little if any attempt at progress, or they 
are spurred on by the seeming desperation of their 
plight to catch up with their more fortunate play- 
mates in spite of their physical handicap. Chil- 
dren obviously have not sufficient intelligence to 
be able to judge their situations correctly. 

It is a significant fact that what determines the 
development of the child is neither his own intrinsic 
ability nor the objective environment, but the in- 
terpretation that the child happens to make of the 
external reality and of his relation to it. The po- 
tentialities which a child brings into the world are 
not of primary importance, nor is our adult judg- 
ment of the child’s situation of any importance. 
What is essential is for us to see the child’s situ- 
ation with the eyes of the child himself, and in- 
terpret it with his own mistaken judgment. We 
must not suppose that the child behaves logically 
■ — ^that is to say, according to adult comnion 


 
sense — ^but we must be ready to recognize that 
children make mistakes in interpreting their own 
positions. Indeed, we must remember that the edu- 
cation of children would he impossible were it not 
for the fact that they make mistakes. We could 
not possibly educate or impro^’-e a child if the mis- 
takes lie made were innate. Consequently, he who 
believes in innate character traits cannot and 
should not educate children. 

It is not true that we always find a healthy 
mind in a healthy body. It is possible to find a 
healthy mind in a sick body when a child faces 
life with courage in spite of physical defects. On 
the other hand, if a child is physically healthy, but 
through an untoward set of circumstances has been 
led to make a fallacious interpretation of his abili- 
ties, he will not be mentally healthy. A failure in 
any given task often makes a child believe in his 
own incapacity. This is because such children are 
extraordinarily sensitive to difficulties and re- 
gard each obstacle as ^ confirmation of their lack 
of power. 

Some children in addition to having difficulties 
in motor activities find it hard to learn to speak. 
Learning to speak should usually accompany 
learning to walk. The two are of course not actu- 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 
ally connected but are dependent upon the rearing 
of the child and the circumstances of the family. 
Some children who would otherwise have no dif- 
ficulty fail to speak because the family neglects to 
help them. It is clear, however, that any child who 
is not deaf and whose speech organs are otherwise 
perfect should learn to speak at a reasonably early 
age. Under certain circumstances, especially in ex- 
tremely visual types, speech is delayed. In other 
cases, parents spoil the child by saying everything 
for him instead of letting him make the attempt 
to express himself. Such a child takes so long to 
learn to speak that we sometimes think he Is deaf. 
When he finally does learn to speak, his interest 
in spealdng has become so intensified that he 
frequently becomes an orator in later life. Klara 
Schumann, the wife of the composer, could not 
speak until she was four and could speak only a 
little even when she was eight. She was a peculiar 
child, veiy reserved, and she preferred to spend 
her time idling in the kitchen. We can deduce 
from this that no one bothered her. “Peculiar,” 
said her father, “that this striking mental discord 
was the beginning of a life so full of wonderful 
harmony.” Hers is an example of an over-com- 
pensation. 



 

One must be careful to see that children who 
are deaf and dumb receive special schooling, be- 
cause it appears to be more and more the fact that 
complete deafness happens infrequently. Mo mat- 
ter how defective a child’s hearing is, his little 
ability to hear should be nursed to the utmost. Pro- 
fessor Katz, in Rostock, has demonstrated that he 
has been able to train children who were considered 
unmusical to a full appreciation of music and the 
beauty of sound. 

Sometimes children who are successful in most 
of their school subjects fail terribly in one, fre- 
quently in mathematics, thereby arousing the 
suspicion of a light form of imbecility. It is always 
possible that children who are not successful in 
arithmetic have at one time or another been 
frightened by the subject and discouraged in their 
attempts to cope with it. There are families, oc- 
casionally among artists, who boast of the fact 
that they cannot calculate. In addition, the gen- 
eral idea that mathematics is harder for girls than 
lor boys is wi’ong. There are many women who are 
excellent mathematicians and expert statisticians. 
Schoolgirls often hear “boys can count better than 
girls” and are discouraged by the remark. 

It is an important indication whether a child 


 
can use figures or not. Mathematics is one of the 
few fields of knowledge which gives a human being 
security. It is a thought-operation which leads to 
the stabilization of surrounding chaos by rmnibers. 
People with a strong feeling of insecurity are 
usually bad calculators. 

This is true of other subjects too. V^riting, the 
affixing to paper of the sounds known only to inner 
consciousness, gives security to the individual. 
Drawing permits making permanent a fleeting 
optical impression. Gymnastics and dancing are 
expressions of attainment to physical security and, 
more especially, by virtue of the sure control of 
our bodies, of a modicum of mental security. Prob- 
ably this is why so many educators are such firm 
believers in sports. 

A striking manifestation of a feeling of in- 
feriority in children is the difficulty in learning to 
swim. When a child learns to swim easily, it is a 
good sign that he will also be able to overcome 
other difficulties. A child who finds it hard to learn 
to swim shows lack of faith in himself and in his 
swimming instructor. It is noteworthy that many 
children who have difficulty at first, become excel- 
lent swimmers later on. These are the children 
who, sensitive to the original difficulty, have been 



 
spurred on by eventual success to a goal of per- 
fection and who frequently become champion 
swimmers « 

It is important to know whether a child is 
particularly attached to one person or is interested 
in several. Usually, a child is attached most deeply 
to his mother, or, failing her, to another member 
of the family. This ability to attach himself is 
present in every child unless he is an imbecile or an 
idiot. When a child has been reared by his mother 
and attaches himself to another person in the 
family, it is important to discover why. Obviously, 
no child should concentrate all his affection and 
attention on his mother, for a mother’s most im- 
portant function is to spread the interest and 
confidence of the child to his fellowmen. Grand- 
parents also play an important role in the develop- 
ment of a child — ^usually a pampering role. The 
reason for if is that aging people are afraid that 
they are no longer necessary. They develop ex- 
aggerated inferiority feelings and as a result as- 
sume the role of nagging critics or of soft-hearted, 
good-natured elders who, in order to make them- 
selves important to the children, deny them noth- 
ing. Children when visiting grandparents are 
often so spoiled that they refuse to return to their 


 


more disciplined homesc Upon tbeir return they 
complain that it is not as nice at home as it is at 
their grandparents’. We mention here the role that 
grandparents sometimes play in the lives of chil- 
dren so that educators will not overlook this im- 
portant fact in investigating the style of life of 
any particular child. 

Clumsiness in movement (Question Two of the 
Psychological Questionnaire^) resulting from 
rickets and remaining unimproved over a long 
period, usually points to the fact that the child 
received too much care and was therefore pam- 
pered. Mothers should have enough intelligence 
not to kill a child’s independence even when the 
child is ill and needs special attention. 

An important question is whether the child has 
given much trouble (Question Three). When we 
hear that this has been the case we can be sure that 
the mother has been too closely attached to the 
child. She has not been successful in establishing 
independence in him. This, trouble-making usually 
manifests itself when going to sleep or getting up, 
in eating and washing, also in nightmares, or 
enuresis (bed-wetting). All these symptoms point 


* See Appendix I. 





 
to an attempt to get the attention of a certain per- 
som One symptom after another appears; it is as 
if the child were discovering one weapon after 
another to use in his fight to dominate the older 
person. We may foe sure that when a child develops 
such symptoms his environment 's weak. Pimish- 
ment does not help, and such children usually tease 
their parents into punishing them in order to show 
them that this punishment is of no avail. 

An especially important question concerns the 
development of the intelligence of the child. This 
is sometimes difficult to answer correctly and it is 
occasionally advisable to resort to Binet tests, 
which, however, do not always give reliable results. 
This is true of all other intelligence tests which 
should never be accepted as constant for the en- 
tire life of the child. In general, the development 
of intelligence depends a great deal upon family 
circumstances. Families in better circumstances 
are able to help their children, and children with 
good physical development usually show a com- 
paratively good mental development. Unfortu- 
nately, it is also so arranged that those children 
who progress more smoothly in their mental 
growth are predetermined to the “quality work,” 
or better jobs; while those who grow more slowly 


 
are assigned to menial work. As far as we have 
been able to observe, the system newly introduced 
in many countries of having special classes for 
weaker children works out so that most of these 
children come from poor families. The conclusion 
to be drawn is that these poorer children, had they 
been siirrouiided by more favorable environment, 
would undoubtedly have been able to compete suc- 
cessfully with children lucky enough to be born 
into families of better material circumstances. 

Another important point to be investigated is 
whether the child has ever been the butt of ridicule 
or discouraged by teasing. Some children can bear 
such discouragement; others lose courage, avoid 
the difficult roads of useful work, and turn their 
attention to outward appearances, an indication 
that a child has little faith in himself. An indica- 
tion of a hostile environment is to be found when 
a child is constantly quarreling with others, afraid 
that if he is not the aggressor the others will at- 
tack first. Such children are disobedient; they be- 
lieve obedience to be a sign of subordination. They 
think that the courteous return of a greeting is a 
degi'adation, they answer impertinently; they 
never complain because they regard the sympathy 
of others as a personal humiliation. They never 


 
cry ill front of others, and sometimes laugh when 
they should cry, which looks like a lack of feeling, 
hut is only an indication of a fear of showing weak- 
ness. No act of cruelty has ever been done which 
has not been based upon a secret weakness. The 
person who is really strong has no feeling for 
cruelty. Such disobedient children are often dirty, 
personal!'}?' negligent, bite their nails and pick their 
noses, and are very stubborn. They need to be en- 
couraged and it must be made clear to them that 
their actions only indicate their fear of appearing 
as weaklings. 

Question Four, namely, whether the child 
makes friends easily or is unfriendly, whether he 
is a leader or a follower, has to do with his ability 
to make contacts — that is to say, with his degree 
of social feeling or discouragement. It also has to 
do with his desire to obey or to rule. When a child 
isolates himself, he indicates that he has not suffi- 
cient confidence in himself to compete with others, 
and that liis striving for superiority is so strong 
that he fears the subordination of his personality 
in the crowd. Children having a tendency to col- 
lect things indicate that they want to strengthen 
themselves and surpass others. This tendency to 
collect is dangerous because it can very easily go 


 
too far and develop into inordinate ambition or 
greed, the expression of a general feeling of weak” 
ness wliicii seeks a point of support. Such children 
are easily led to steal when they believe that they 
have been neglected or overlooked, because they 
feel this lack of attention more than others. 

Question Five concerns the child’s attitude to 
school. We must notice whether he is tardy and 
whether he is excited about going to school (such 
excitement frequently being an indication of reluc- 
tance). The fears the children have in the face of 
certain situations are variously expressed. When 
they have homework to do, they become irritable; 
they have what seems like a heart palpitation 
caused by the tense state into w^hicli they work 
themselves. One type in particular may have cer- 
tain organic changes, such as sexual excitement. 
The system of giving children marks is not always 
a commendable one. Children would be relieved of 
a great burden if they were not classified in such a 
way. School becomes a sort of constant examina- 
tion or test in which a good mark is necessary to 
strive for, while a bad mark is like a permanent 
judgment. 

Does the child do his homework willingly, or 


 
must lie be forced to do it? To forget to do one’s 
homework shows the tendency to avoid responsi- 
bility. Unsatisfactory school work and impatience 
with it are sometimes means used for escaping 
schools because the child wants to do something 
else. 

Is the child lazy? When a child fails in school 
work, lie prefers to have laziness as the reason 
rather than inability. When a lazy child performs 
one task ivell, he is praised, and then he hears, “He 
could accomplish so much if he were not lazy.” The 
child is satisfied with this opinion because he is 
convinced that he no longer has to prove his ability. 

To this type belong also the indolent children who 
lack courage, who cannot concentrate, who are 
always dependent ; pampered children who disturb 
classroom work because they want to draw atten- 
tion to themselves. 

The question, What is the child’s attitude 
toivard his teacher? is not an easy one to answer. 

Children usually mask their real feelings toward 
their teachers. When a child constantly criticizes, 
and tries to humiliate his school friends, we may 
assume that this tendency to degrade is an indica- 
tion of his own lack of faith in himself. Such 

I 

" ' • ' • ■ , , , I, 


 
children are arrogant, nagging, always know 
everyttiing better than the others. This attitude 
masks their oivn weakness. 

Children more difficult to handle are the indif- 
ferent, apathetic, passive ones. They also wear a 
mask since are not really so indifferent. When 
such children are driven be^mnd control, their re- 
action generally takes the form of a fit of furious 
passion or an attempt at suicide. They never do 
anything until they are ordered to do so. They 
are afraid of setbacks and overvalue other per- 
sons. They must be encouraged. 

Children who show themselves ambitious in 
sport or gyunnastics betray the fact that they have 
been ambitious in other directions, but have been 
afraid of defeat. Children who read far more than 
is customary lack courage and indicate that they 
hope to win power through reading. Such chil- 
dren have a rich imaginative life but are timid in 
facing reality. It is also important to note what 
kind of stories children prefer: novels, fairy tales, 
biographies, travel or objective, scientific works. 
During puberty children are easily attracted to 
pornogi-aphic hooks. It is unfortunate that in every 
large city there are bookstores that make a prac- 
tice of selling such printed matter. The increased 


 
sexual drive and the longing for experience turn 
their thoughts in this direction. The following 
means are to be employed in combatting such harm- 
ful influences: preparation of children for their 
role as fellow men, sexual clarification at an early 
age and friendly relations with their parents. 

Question Six concerns family conditions — sick- 
ness in the family, such as alcoholism, neuroses, 
tuberculosis, lues (syphilis), epilepsy. It is also 
important to have a comprehensive physical his- 
tory of the child. A child who breathes through his 
mouth frequently has a stupid facial expression, 
resulting from adenoids and tonsils which prevent 
correct breathing. An operation to remove such 
obstructions is important, and sometimes the be- 
lief that the operation is going to help him gives 
the child more courage to tackle school upon his 
return. 

Sickness in the family frequently harms the 
progress of a child. Parents who are chronically 
ill burden their children heavily. Nervous and 
psychic disorders oppress the whole family. When- 
ever it is possible, children should not be permitted 
to know that a member of the family has become 
mentally afflicted. A mental disorder casts a 
shadow over the whole family apart from the su- 



 
perstition that it can be inherited. This is also true 
of the innumerable cases of tuberculosis and cancer. 
All such diseases mate a horrible impression on 
the mind of a child and it is sometimes much better 
to take the child out of such a home atmosphere. 
Chronic alcoholism or criminal inclinations within 
a family act like a poison which the child is fre- 
quently unahle to resist. However, there are dif- 
ficulties in the way of the proper placement of 
children taken from such homes. Epileptics are 
usually ii’ritable and disturb the harmony of fam- 
ily life. But what is worst of all is syphilis. Chil- 
dren of syphilitic parents are usually very weakj 
inherit the disease and find it tragically hard to 
cope with life. 

We cannot overlook the fact that the material 
conditions of the family color the child’s outlook 
on life. Poverty in comparison with the better eir- 
eumstances of other children arouses a feeling of 
insufficiency. Children who are moderately well-off 
find it difficult to go without their customary com- 
forts if the family’s finances decline. The tension 
is still greater when grandparents are better off 
than the parents, as in the case of Peter Ghent, 
who could not rid himself of the thought that his 
grandfather was extremely powerful while his 


THE EDUCATION OP CHILDREN 
father failed, in everything. A child often becomes 
industrious as a protest against an indolent father. 

The first contact with death when it comes sud- 
denly is frequently a shock great enough to influ- 
ence the whole life of the child. A child who is un- 
prepared for death and is suddenly brought face to 
face with it, realizes for the first time that life has 
an end. This may discourage the child completely, 
or at least make him very timid. In the biographies 
of doctors we often find that their choice of a pro- 
fession was caused by a brusque meeting with death, 
a proof that a child is deeply affected by his realiza- 
tion of death. It is not advisable to burden children 
with this problem because they are not able to com- 
prehend it entirely. Orphans or step-children often 
blame their unhappiness on the death of their par- 
ents. 

It Is important to know who has the deciding 
voice ill the family. Usually it is the father. When 
a mother or a step-mother dominates, the results 
are abnormal, and the father frequently loses the 
respect of his children. Sons of dominating 
mothers usually carry with them a certain fear of 
women of which they rarely can rid themselves. 
Such men either avoid women or make life un- 
pleasant for the women in their families. 

Ill 


 

It is further necessary to know whether the 
cliiid’s rearing has been strict or mild. Individual 
Psychologists do not believe that either severe or 
mild methods should be used in rearing children. 
What is necessary is understanding, avoidance of 
mistakes and constant encouragement of the child 
to face and solve his problems and develop social 
feeling. Parents who nag their children harm them., 
for they discourage the children completely. A 
pampering education develops a dependent at- 
titude and a tendency to cling to one person. Par- 
ents should avoid both the painting of rosy pic- 
tures and the describing of the %vorld in pessimistic 
terms. Their job is to give the child as good a 
preparation for life as possible, so that the child 
will be able to take care of himself. Children who 
have not been taught how to face difficulties will 
seek to avoid every hardship, which leads to an 
ever-narrowing circle of activity. 

It is important to know who has charge of the 
children. It is not necessarjr that a mother be con- 
stantly with her children, hut she must know the 
person in whose care she places them. The best 
way to teach a child is to let him learn from experi- 
ence, within reason, so that his conduct is guided 


 
not by tlie restrictions placed upon film by others 
but by tlie logic of facts. 

Question Seven concerns the position of the child 
in the family constellation, which is most sug- 
gestive of the child’s character. An only child is 
ill a peculiar situation; a youngest child, an only 
boy among girls or an only girl among boys, are 
also ill peculiar positions. 

Question Eight concerns the choice of an oc- 
cupation. This is an important question because it 
reveals to us the influence of the environment, the 
amount of the child’s courage and social feeling, 
and the life rhythm of the child. Day-dreams (ques- 
tion nine) are also significant, as well as early 
childliood remembrances (question ten). Those 
people who have learned to interpret childhood 
remembrances can frequently discover from them 
the entire style of life. Dreams are also an indica- 
tion of the direction in which a child is going, an 
indication of whether he is attempting to solve or 
to evade his problem. It is important to know 
whether a child has speech defects; further, 
whether he is ugly or good-looking, well-formed 
or badly-formed (question thirteen). 

Question Fourteen. Will the child discuss his 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDBEN 
situation openly or not? Some children are given to 
boasting as a compensation for their feeling of in- 
feriority. Others refuse to talk, fearing that they 
will be taken a,dvantage of, or fearing a new hurt 
if they betray their weakness. 

Question Fifteen. A child who is successful in 
one subject, say in drawing or music, must be en- 
couraged on the basis of this to improve in his other 
subjects. 

Children who at the age of fifteen do not know 
what they want to become, are to be regarded as 
completely discouraged and must be treated ac- 
cordingly. The occupation of the members of the 
family as well as the social differences in rank be- 
tween the brothers and sisters, must be considered. 
The whole development of a child can be harmed 
by the unhappy marriage of the parents. It is the 
duty of the teacher to proceed with prudence, to 
form a correct picture of the child and his environ- 
ment, and to arrange his treatment and his at- 
tempts to improve the child in accordance with 
the knowledge gained from the questionnaire. 




CHAPTEB, SEVEH 


SOCIAL FEELING AND THE OBSTACLES 
TO ITS DEVELOPMENT 

I N contrast to the cases of superiority striving 
we have discussed in the previous chapters, 
there is to be found a tendency among many chiL 
dren and adults to unite themselves with other 
human beings, to accomplish their tasks in co- 
operation with others and to make themselves 
generally useful from a social point of view. Such 
manifestations may best be described by the term 
social feeling. What is the root of this feeling? 
This is a matter of some controversy. But so far 
as the present wi’iter has been able to discover, it 
seems that we have to do here with a phenomenon 
that is indissolubly connected with the very notion 
of man. 

One may perhaps ask in what sense such a psy- 
chological sentiment is more innate than the 
psychological striving for superiority. The an- 
swer -would be that both at bottom have the same 

.. 116 ■ ■■ 


 
core — that the individualistic desire for supremacy 
and the feeling of social-mindedness rest on the 
same basis in human nature. They both are ex™ 
pressions of a root desire for affirmation ; they dif- 
fer in their form, and their different forms involve 
different implicit judgments about human nature. 
Thus the individualistic striving for supremacy 
involves a judgment that the individual can do 
without the group, while the feeling of social^ 
iiiindedness involves the view of a certain depend- 
ence upon the group. As views on human nature, 
there is no doubt that the social feeling is superior 
to the individualistic striving. The former rep- 
resents a sounder and logically more fundamental 
outlook, while the latter is only a superficial view- 
point even though as a psychological phenomenon 
it is more often to be met with in the lives of in- 
dividuals. 

If we want to see in what sense the social feel- 
ing has truth’ and logic on its side we have only to 
observe man historically, and we shall notice that 
man has always lived in groups. Nor is this fact 
astonishing when we reflect further that those 
creatures who individually are not able to protect 
themselves have been compelled always to live to- 
ne 


 
getlier for self-preservation. We have only to coni” 
pare a human being with a lion to realize that man, 
regarded as a species of animal, is quite insecure, 
and that most other animals comparable in size to 
man are stronger and better armed by nature for 
physical offense and defense. Darwin observed 
that all animals whose defense equipment has been 
somewhat neglected by nature always travel in 
packs. The orang-utan, for example, with his ex- 
traordinary bodily strength, lives alone with his 
mate, while the smaller and weaker members of the 
ape family are always to be found in groups. The 
formation of groups serves, as Darwin has pointed 
out, as a substitute or compensation for that which 
nature has denied to the animals individually — 
claws, fangs, wings, etc. 

The formation of groups not only balances what 
the particular animals lack as individuals, but it 
also leads them to discover new methods of protec- 
tion which improve their situation. There are 
groups of monkeys, for instance, who know how 
to send out advance scouts to discover the presence 
of enemies. In this way they are able to bring to 
bear their massed strength so as to more than make 
up for the weakness of each member of the group. 



 
We also find a buffalo herd massing itself together 
and thus defending the group successfully against 
individual enemies of far greater power. 

Animal sociologists who have studied this prob- 
lem also report that in these groups we often find 
arrangements which are the equivalent of laws. 
Thus the scouts that are sent ahead must live ac- 
cording to certain rules, and every blunder or in- 
fraction is punished by the whole herd. 

It is interesting to note in this connection that 
many historians assert that the oldest laws of man- 
kind were those which affected the watchmen of 
the tribe. If this is so, we have a picture of the in- 
vention of the group idea out of the inability of 
weaker forms of animal life to protect themselves. 
And in a certain sense the feeling of social-minded- 
ness is always a reflection of physical weakness and 
is inseparable from it. Thus in the case of human 
beings perhaps the most important situation that 
fosters social feeling is the helplessness and slow 
development of infants and children. 

In the whole realm of animal life we find no 
being except man whose young come into the 
world with such complete helplessness. Also, as we 
know, the human child requires the longest time to 
reach maturity. This is not because of the infinite 


 
niimber of things a child must leam before he be- 
comes an adult, but because of the way he de- 
velops. Children need the protection of the parents 
Hiiicli longer because . their organism demands it, 
and the Iiiimaii race would die out if children were 
not afforded such protection. The physical weak- 
ness of the child may be taken as the occasion 
which links together education and social-minded- 
ness. Education is a necessity because of the 
child’s physical immaturity, and the goal of educa- 
tion is provided by the fact that the overcoming of 
the child’s immaturity can only be had by relying 
on the group. Education must necessarily be social 
in purpose. 

In all our rules and methods for the education 
of children we must always have the idea of com- 
munity life and social adjustment to it. Whether 
we know it or not we are always impressed more 
favorably by that which is good from the stand- 
point of the community, and less favorably by an 
act which is generally disadvantageous or harmful 
to society. 

All educational mistakes which we observe are 
mistakes only because we judge that they will pro- 
duce harmful effects on the community. All great 
accomplishments, and in fact all development of a 



 
human being’s abilities take place under the pres- 
sure of social life and in the direction of social 
feeling. 

Let us take, for example, speech. A human 
being living alone needs no knowledge of speech. 
That human beings have developed speech is an 
indisputable indication of the necessity for com- 
munal life. Speech is a distinct bond between peo- 
ple and at the same time a product of tlieir living 
together. The psychology of speech is conceivable 
only when we use as a point of departure the idea 
of the community. Individuals living alone have 
no interest in speech. Whenever a child lacks this 
broad base of participation in the community and 
grows up isolated, his ability to speak will be re- 
tarded. What we call a talent for speaking can 
only be acquired and improved when one individ- 
ual attaches himself to others. 

It has been commonly assumed that those chil- 
dren who can express themselves better than others 
are simply more talented,. This is not true. Those 
children who find difiiculty in speaking or in mak- 
ing contact through speech usually do not have 
strong social feeling. Children who do not learn 
to speak well are frequently spoiled children, for 
whom their mothers do everything before the chiT 


 
dreii have time to ask for anything. In this way 
they lose contact and the ability for social adjust- 
iiient because they do not need speech. 

There are also some children who are reluctant 
to speak because their parents never permit them 
to finish a sentence or to answer for themselves; 
others have been laughed at or ridiculed, and 
thereby discouraged. This constant correcting and 
nagging seems to be a widely spread malpractice 
in . The dire result is that 
such children carry with them for years a feeling 
of degradation and inferiority. One can notice it in 
such persons who use the stereotyped introduction 
before they begin a sentence: “But, please don’t 
laugh at me.” We hear this frequently and we 
recognize at once that such people were laughed at 
frequently when they were children. 

There is the case of a child who could speak and 
hear but whose parents were both deaf and dumb. 
He alway’-s cried without making any sound when 
he hurt himself. It was necessary to let his parents 
see the pain, but useless to make his suffering 
audible. 

The development of other abilities of human 
beings, for example, the growth of understanding 
or of a logical sense, is unthinkable without social 





 
feeling. A man living absolutely alone lias no need 
of logic, or at least has no more need than any other 
animal. On the other hand, a man who is always 
in contact with others, who must use speech and 
logic and common sense in his dealings with others, 
must develop or acquire social feeling. This is the 
final goal of all logical thought. 

Occasionally the actions of people appear stupid 
to us when in reality these actions are quite intel- 
ligent in the light of their personal goals. This fre- 
quently happens with those people who think that 
everybody else must think as they do, which shows 
us how significant the factor of social feeling or 
common sense is in judgment (not to mention that 
the development of common sense would not be 
necessary if communal life were not so complicated 
and did not present the individual with so many 
intricate problems). We can very well imagine 
that primitive people have remained at a primitive 
level because the relative simplicity of their ex- 
istence did not stimulate them to deeper thought. 

Social feeling plays a most important part in 
the ability of human beings to speak and to think 
logically — two functions which we might almost 
regard as holy. If everyone attempted to solve his 
problems regardless of the community in which he 


 
lived, or to use a language of his own, chaos would 
resiihL Social feeling gives a security which each 
individual can feel and which is for him the main 
support ill life. It may not he completely identical 
with the confidence that we derive from logical 
thought and truth, but it is the most palpable 
component of that confidence. To take an illustra- 
tion, why are calculating and counting so coil”* 
fidently accepted on ail sides so that we tend to 
regard as precisely true only that which we can 
express in numbers? The reason is that number 
operations are more easily communicable to our 
fellow men, at the same time that they are easier 
for the mind to work with. We do not have much 
confidence in truths which we cannot communicate 
to others and have others share with us. This train 
of thought was doubtless behind Plato’s attempt to 
model all philosophy on number and mathematics. 
We see the connection with social feeling even 
more closely from the fact that he wanted the 
philosopher to go back to the “cave,” that is to 
say, to participate in the life of his fellow men. 
Even the philosopher, he felt, could not live prop- 
erly without the security that comes from social 
feeling. 

Cliildren who have, so to speak, less of an ac- 


 
cumulation of this feeling of security, reveal it 
when they come in contact with others or when 
they have to perform certain tasks on tlieir own 
initiative. They reveal it particularly in school in 
those subjects which require objective, logical 
thinking, as in mathematics. 

The conceptions for which a human being is 
prepared in childhood (for example, moral feel- 
ings, ethics, etc.) are usually presented in a one- 
sided manner. An ethics for a human being who is 
condemned to live alone is inconceivable. Morals 
are only in place when we think of the community 
and the rights of others. This view is a little more 
difficult to confirm when we think of aesthetic feel- 
ings, of our inclination to artistic creations. How- 
ever, even in the realm of art w’e can perceive a 
generally consistent impression which probably has 
its basic roots in an understanding of health, 
strength, correct social development, etc. So far 
as art is concerned the boundaries are elastic, and 
there is perhaps more room for individual taste. On 
the whole, however, even esthetics follows social 
lines. 

If the practical question is put to us — ^how can 
we tell the degree to which social feeling has been 
developed in a child? — ^we must answer that there 


 
are certain conduct manifestations to be con- 
sidered. When we see, for example, that children, 
in their striving for superiority, force themselves 
to the front with no consideration for others, we 
may be sure that they have less social feeling than 
those children who avoid that particular procedure. 
It is impossible to imagine a child in our present 
civilization without some desire for individualistic 
supremacy. As a result, his degree of social feel- 
ing is usually not sufficiently developed. This is 
the condition which the critics of mankind, the old 
and modern moralists have always complained of 
— that man is by nature egotistical and thirties 
more of himself than he does of others. This has 
always been expressed in the form of a sermon 
which has no effect on children or adults, because 
nothing can be accomplished with this axiom alone, 
and people have eventually consoled themselves by 
thinking that everybody else is no better. 

When we deal with children whose ideas have 
become so confused that they have developed 
harmful or criminal tendencies, we must recognize 
that no amount of moral preaching has ever had 
any effect. In such a situation it is much more 
desirable to probe a little deeper in order to he able 
to abolish the evil by pulling up the roots. In other 


 
words, we must relinquish our role of judge and 
assume that of comrade or doctor. 

If we constantly tell a child that he is bad or 
stupid, he will become convinced in a short time 
that we are right and he will not have sufficient 
courage thereafter to tackle any task presented to 
him. What happens then is that the child fails in 
whatever he tries to do. The belief that he is stupid 
takes firmer root. He does not understand that the 
environment originally destroyed his self-con- 
fidence and that he is subconsciously arranging his 
life to prove this fallacious judgment correct. The 
child feels himself less able than his comrades, he 
feels himself restricted in abilities and possibilities. 
His attitude shows unmistakably his depressed 
frame of mind, which is in direct proportion to the 
amount of pressure exerted upon him by an un- 
favorable environment. 

Individual Psychology has tried to show that the 
influence of the environment is always perceptible 
in every mistake made hy^a child; for example, a 
disorderly child is always in the shadow of a per«» 
son who puts his things in order ; a child who lies is 
always under the influence of a domineering adult 
who wants to cure the child of lying by harsh 
means. We can even detect traces of the environ- 




THE EDUCATION OF CHILDBEN 
merit in a cliiH’s boasting. Such a child usually 
feels that praise is a necessity, and not the success- 
ful accomplishment of any given task; and in his 
striving for superiority he is constantly seeking to 
evoke laudatory comments from the members of 
his family. 

There are situations in the life of every child 
which parents have usually overlooked or misun- 
derstood. Thus, each child in a family of brothers 
and sisters is in a different situation. The first 
child has the unique position of having been for a 
while the only child. This experience is unknown 
to a second-born. The youngest child experiences 
a set of circumstances which not every child goes 
through, because he remains for a while the small- 
est and weakest in the environment. There are 
variations of these situations. When two brothers 
or two sisters grow up together, the one who is 
naturally older and more competent has overcome 
certain difficulties which the younger has still to 
conquer. The younger of two such children is in 
a relatively unfavorable position and feels it. To 
compensate for this feeling of inferiority, the child 
may increase his striving so as to overtake the older 
brother or sister. 




 

Individual psychologists who have worked for 
a long time with children are usually able to detect 
the position that children have had in the family 
constellation. Wlien the older child is one that has 
made normal progress, the younger one has been 
stimulated to greater effort to keep up with the 
older. As a result the younger is usually more ac» 
tive and more aggressive. If the older child has 
been weak and has developed slowly, the younger 
is not forced to make quite so strong an effort in 
competition. 

It is, therefore, important to determine what 
position a child has had in the family since a child 
can be completely understood only when his place 
in the family constellation has been discovered. 
The youngest children in families bear umnistak- 
able signs of the fact that they have been the 
youngest. Of course there are exceptions but the 
most common type of the youngest child is the one 
who wants to surpass all the others, the one who 
is never quiet, who is always stirred to further ac- 
tion by the feeling and belief that he must eventu- 
ally amount to more than all the others. These 
observations are significant for the education of 
children because they condition the adoption of 
certain educational methods. It is impossible to 


 
follow the same rules in handling all children. 
Each child is unique, and while we classify chil- 
dren according to certain general types, we must 
be careful to treat each child as an individual. This 
is a condition almost impossible to fulfill in the 
school, but certainly one obtainable at home. 

The youngest child belongs to the type which 
always wants to be in the foreground of any pic- 
ture and in many cases he is successful. This is an 
extraordinarily important consideration since it 
weakens considerably the notion of the inheritance 
of mental characteristics. When youngest children 
of different families bear so much resemblance to 
each other there is not much room for the belief in 
inheritance. 

Another type of youngest child, directly op- 
posite to the active one described above, is the com- 
pletely discouraged adolescent. Such a child is as 
indolent as possible. We can understand that the 
seemingly great difference between these two types 
is explainable psychologically. No one is so easily 
hurt by difficulties as he who has the inordinate 
ambition to excel all others. His ambition makes 
him unliappy, and when the obstacles seem almost 
insurmountable be takes to flight more quickly 
than one whose striving does not have such an im- 


 
portant goal We see in these two' types of young- 
est child the personification of the Latin saying 
“Aiit Csesarj aut nullus” or, as we say^ or 
nothing.” 

In the Bible we can find excellent descriptions 
of youngest children which coincide exactly with 
our experience — for example, the stories of Jo-- 
seph, David, Saul, etc. The objection that may be 
raised that Joseph had a younger brother, Ben^ 
jamin, may be refuted by the fact that Benjamin 
was born when Joseph was seventeen years old, 
so that Joseph as a child was the youngest^ How 
often do we see in life families supported by the 
youngest child. We find confirmation for our as- 
sertion concerning the youngest child not only in 
the Bible but also in fairy tales. There is no fairy 
tale in which the youngest child does not surpass 
all his brothers and sisters — ^in German, Russian, 
Scandinavian or Chinese fairy tales the youngest 
is always the conqueror. It is impossible that this 
should he only coincidence^. It is probably caused 
by the fact that in former days the figure of the 
youngest child was much more salient than it is 
to-day. This type must have been better observed 
because it was probably easier to notice under 
primitive conditions. 




 

Much more could be written about the charac“ 
teristics which children deyelop in accordance with 
their position in the family constellation. Oldest 
cliildren also have many characteristics in common 
and may be divided into two or three main types. 

The present witer bad been studying the matter 
for a long time and the subject was not quite clear 
in his mind when he accidentally stumbled upon 
a passage in Fontane’s autobiography. Fontane 
describes there how his father, a French emigrant, 
took part in a war of Poland against Russia. His 
father was always very happy when he read, for 
example, that ten thousand Poles had beaten fifty 
thousand Russians and put them to flight. Fontane 
could not understand Ms father’s joy. On the con- 
trary, he objected very much on the ground that 
fifty thousand Russians simply had to be stronger 
than ten thousand Poles, and “if that isn’t so, it 
doesn’t please me at all because the stronger should 
always remain the stronger.” In reading this para- 
graph we immediately^ junip to the conclusion, 
“Fontane is an oldest child I” Only an oldest child 
could make such a statement. He remembers his 
possession of power in the family when he was the 
only child and feels it an injustice to be dethroned 
by a iveaker person. As a matter of fact it has been 


 
found that oldest children usually have a conserva- 
tive trait. They are believers in power, in rule, and 
in unbreakable laws. They have a tendency to ac- 
cept despotism quite frankly and without apology. 
They have the right attitude for positions of power 
because they have once occupied such positions 
themselves. 

There are exceptions, as we have said, in the 
types of oldest children. There is one exception 
which should be mentioned here. It concerns a 
problem in child life which has hitherto been neg- 
lected. This is the tragic role which an older boy 
plays when he has a younger sister. Descriptions of 
confused, completely discouraged boys have very 
often indicated, without the fact itself being men- 
tioned, that the trouble was a younger, clever 
sister. The frequency with which this occurs is not 
an accident because there is a natural explanation 
for it. We know that in our present civilization 
men are considered of more importance than 
women. A first-horn son is frequently pampered. 
His parents expect a great deal of him. His situ- 
ation is a favorable one until a sister suddenly ap- 
pears. The girl enters an environment which con- 
tains a spoiled older brother who regards her as an 
amioying intruder and who fights against her. 



 
This situation spurs the girl on to make extraordi- 
nary effortSs and if she does not break down, this 
stimulation affects her whole life. The girl de- 
velops rapidly and frightens the older boy, who 
suddenly sees the fiction of masculine superiority 
destroyed. He becomes uncertain, and since nature 
has so arranged matters that girls between the 
ages of foui'teeii and sixteen develop mentally and 
physically more rapidly than boys, his uncertainty 
is likely to end in a complete defeat. He easily 
loses his belief in himself and gives up the fight, 
arranges plausible excuses, or puts difficulties in 
his own way which he can then use as alibis for 
ceasing to struggle. 

There is a great number of such first-born boys 
who are confused, hopeless, inexplicably lazy, or 
suffering from nervousness for no other reason than 
that they did not feel strong enough to compete 
with a younger sister. Such boys are sometimes 
possessed of an unbelievable hatred of the female 
sex. Their fate is usualjy a sad one because there 
are few people who understand their condition and 
can explain it to them. Sometimes it goes so far 
that parents and other members of the family com- 
plain, “Why isn’t it the other way around? Why 
isn’t the boy a girl, and the girl a boy ?” 



 
Boys who are alone among several sisters also 
have characteristics in common. It is difficult to 
prevent a dominantly feminine atmosphere in a 
house where there are several girls and only one 
boy. It either happens that he is very much spoiled 
by all the members of the family, or that all the 
women exclude him. Such boys naturally develop 
differently, but certain traits are common to all of 
them. We know that the conception that boys 
should not be educated by women exclusively is 
very widespread. That is not to be taken literally, 
since all boys are first reared by women. But what 
is really meant is that boys should not he brought 
up in an environment of women. This is not an 
argument against femininity but against the mis- 
understandings which arise out of such a situation. 
It also holds good for a girl who grows up with 
boys. The boys usually look down upon the girl 
and she tries, as a result, to imitate the boys in 
order to be their equal, which is an unfortunate 
preparation for her later Hfe. 

No matter how tolerant one is, it is impossible 
to join in the chorus of those who believe that girls 
should be brought up like boys. One can do it for 
a while hut certain unavoidable differences make 


 


tliemselves quickly apparent. Men have different 
roles to play in life determined by tlieir difference 
in physical structure. This plays a part in the 
choice of a profession and girls who are not satis- 
fied with their feminine role sometimes find great 
difficulty in adjusting themselves to the occupa- 
tions open to them. When we come to the question 
of preparation for marriage, it is clear that the 
education for the role of a woman must be different 
from that for the part of a man. Girls who are 
dissatisfied with their sex will object to marriage 
as a personal degradation or if they do marry 
they will try to rule. Boys who have been brought 
up. like girls will also experience great difficulty in 
adjusting themselves to our present form of civili- 
zation. 

We must not forget in considering all this that a 
child’s style of life is usually determined by the 
time he is four or five years old. Those are the 
years during which he must develop social feeling 
and the flexibility necq^sary for adjustment. By 
the time a child is five years old his attitude to his 
environment is usually so fixed and mechanized 
that it proceeds in more or less the same direction 
for the rest of his life. His apperception of the 


) 



 
outer world remains the same; the child is caught 
in the trap of his perspectives and repeats unceas- 
ingly his original mental mechanisms and the re- 
suiting actions. Social feeling is limited by the 
boundaries of the individuaFs mental horizon.
