CHAPTER THIRTEEN 


PEDAGOGICAL. MISTAJ^ES 

I N tile rearing of children there are some things 
which the parent or teacher must never allow 
to discourage him. He must never grow hopeless be- 
cause his efforts do not meet with immediate suc- 
cess ; he must not anticipate defeat because the child 
is lethargic or apathetic or extremely passive; nor 
must he permit himself to he influenced by the super- 
stition that there are gifted or ungifted children. In- 
dividual Psychology claims that the effort should be 
made with all children to stimulate their mental 
faculties by giving them more courage, more faith 
in themselves ; by teaching them that difficulties are 
not to be regarded as insurmountable obstacles, but 
as problems to meet and conquer. Success will not 
always attend such efforts, but the many cases which 
are successful more than compensate for those which 
do not produce spectacular results. The following is 
an interesting case in which our efforts were suc- 
cessful; 





 

TMs was the case of a tYvelve-year-old boy in liis 
sixth year at elementary school. He had bad marks 
and was not in the least disturbed by them. He had 
an unusually infelicitous past history. He could not 
walk until he was about three years old on account 
of ridcets. At the end of his third year he was able 
to speak only a few wmrds. When he was four^ liis 
mother took him to a child psychologist who told 
her that the case was hopeless. The mother, however, 
did not believe this, and placed the child in a child 
guidance institute. There he developed “slowly and 
without much help from the institute. When the boy 
was six it was decided that he was able to enter 
school. During the first two years at school, he re- 
ceived extra tutoring at home, so that he was able 
to pass his school examinations. He managed to get 
through the third class and through the fourth as 
well. 

The situation at school and at home was as fol- 
lows : The boy made himself noticeable at school by 
his great indolence; he complained that he did not 
seem able to concentrate and could not listen with 
attention. He did not get along well with his school- 
mates, was teased by them and always showed him- 
self weaker than the others. Among all his school- 
mates he had only one friend whom he liked very 


 
inucli and with whom he went walking. He found the 
other children disagreeable and was unable to make 
contact with them. The teacher complained that the 
boy was weak in arithmetic and that he could not 
write; this in spite of the fact that the teacher was 
convinced that the hoy was capable of accomplish- 
ing as much as the others. 

In the light of the boy’s past history and what he 
had already been able to do, it was clear that the 
treatment of the boy had been based on a mistaken 
diagnosis. Here was a child suffering from an in- 
tense feeling of inferiority — in short, an inferiority 
complex. The boy had an older brother who got 
along very well. His parents claimed that he was 
able to enter high school without ever studying. 
Parents like to say that their children do not have 
to study anything, and the children themselves then 
like to boast of it. It is evident that learning without 
some sort of studying is impossible. This older 
brother probably trained himself to do most of his 
studying in the classroom by listening intently and 
retaining what he heard and saw at school. Children 
who do not pay so much attention in school have to 
do their studying at home. 

What a difference between the two boys! Our 
child had to live constantly under the oppressive 


 
feeling that he was less capable than his brother, 
and that he was worth infinitely less than lie. He 
probably heard this often enough from Ms mother 
when she was angry with him, or from Ills brother 
who used to call him a fool or an idiot. His mother 
said that the older brother often kicked the younger 
when the latter did not obey him. We had the result 
before us ; a human being who believed that he was 
worth less than others. Life seemed to confirm his 
belief. His schoolmates laughed at him; his school 
work was always faulty; he said he could not 
concentrate. Every difficulty frightened him. His 
teacher remarked from time to time that the cMld 
did not belong in that class or in that school. It is 
no wonder that the child finally believed that it was 
impossible to avoid the situation into which he had 
fallen, and he was convinced that the opinion which 
others had of him was correct. It is pathetic when a 
child is so discouraged that he has no faith in the 
future. 

It was easy to see that this child had lost his faitM 
not because he trembled and grew pale when we be» 
gan to chat with him in a cheery fashion, but from 
a small sign which should always be noted. When 
we asked him how old he was (we knew that he was 


 


twelve) he ansv/ered; “Eleven years/* One should 
never take such an answer to be an accident since 
most children know exactly how old they are. We 
have often had occasion to ascertain that such mis- 
takes have underlying reasons. When we consider 
what has happened in the life of this childj and then 
remember his answer, we get the impression that he 
is trying to recapture his past. He wants to return 
to the past, to the time when he was smaller, weaker 
and more in need of help than he is now'. 

We can reconstruct his system from the facts al- 
ready at our disposal. This child does not seek his 
salvation in the accomplishment of those tasks usu- 
ally given to a child of his age; but he believes and 
behaves as if he were not as fully developed as others 
and could not compete with them. This state of feel- 
ing himself behind the others is expressed in the re- 
duction of his years. It is possible that he answers 
“eleven years” and behaves, under certain circum- 
stances, like a child of five. He is so convinced of his 
inferiority that he attempts to adjust all his activities 
to this supposed state of being backward. 

The child still wet himself in the daytime and he 
was unable to control his bowel movements. These 
are symptoms which appear when a child believes or 


 
wants to believe tliat he is still a baby. They confirm 
our statement that this boy wanted to cling to the 
past, and to return to it if possible. 

There w'as a governess in the house who had been 
there before the child was born. She was very niucli 
attached to the child, and took the mother’s place 
whenever possible, acting as the child’s support. We 
could draw further conclusions. We already know 
how the boy lived, we know that he did not like to 
get up early in the morning. A description of how 
long it took him to arise was given us with a gesture 
of disgust. Our conclusion was that the boy did not 
like to go to school. A boy who does not get along 
with his schoolmates, who feels himself oppressed, 
who does not believe that he is capable of accom- 
plishing anything, cannot possibly want to go to 
school. As a result, he will not want to get up in time 
for school. 

His governess, however, said that he did want to 
go to school. In fact when he was sick recently he 
begged to be allowed to get jup. This does not con- 
tradict in the least what we said. The question to be 
answered is, “How can the governess make such a 
mistake?” The circumstances were clear and amus- 
ing. When the boy was sick, he could permit him- 
self to say that he wanted to go to school, since he 



 
knew positively that Ms governess would reply, 
“You cannot go because you are sick.” His family, 
however, did not understand the seeming contradic- 
tion, and they were confused in their attempts to do 
something with the boy. We also had frequent op- 
portunities to observe that the governess was in- 
capable of understanding wliat was actually going 
on in the boy’s mind. 

Something else had developed which was the im- 
mediate cause of bringing the hoy to us. He had 
taken money from the governess to buy candy. That 
also meant that he was behaving like a small child. 
To take money for candy is extremely childish. Very 
young children carry on in this fashion when they 
cannot control their greed for candy; they are the 
children who also cannot control their bodily func- 
tions. The psychological significance of this is : “You 
must watch me, otherwise I am capable of doing 
something naughty.” The boy tried constantly to ar- 
range situations which would make others occupy 
themselves with him because he had no confidence 
in himself. When we compared his situation at home 
and at school, the connection was clear. At home he 
could get people to occupy themselves with him; 
in school he could not. But who attempted to do 
something to correct the child’s conduct? 



THE EDUCATION OF CHILDMEN 

Up to the time the boy was broiiglit to us be was 
regarded as a backward, inferior child, and be did 
not in the least deserve this classification. He was a 
completely normal child who could accomplish as 
much as any of his schoolmates as soon as he regained 
faith in himself. He had always been inclined to view 
everything pessimistically, to accept defeat before 
he had made one step forward. His lack of self- 
confidence was expressed in every gesture and was 
confirmed in his teacher’s report : “Cannot concen- 
trate; weak memory; inattentive; has no friends; 
etc.” His discouragement was so patent that no one 
would overlook it and circumstances were so much 
against him that it would have been difiScult to 
change his point of view. 

After our Individual Psychological questionnaire 
had been filled out the consultation followed. We 
had to confer not only with the boy but with a whole 
group of persons. First, the mother, who had long 
since given him up as hopeless and only tried to keep 
him going so that he would eyentiiall}^ be able to do 
some sort of work. Second, the older brother, who 
looked upon the younger boy with contempt. 

Our boy naturally had no answer to the question, 
“'^¥hat do you want to be when you grow up?” This 
is unusually characteristic. It is always suspicious 



 
Fvlieii a lialf-grown child ideally does not know wliat 
lie wants to become. It is true that people do not 
generally land in the profession they chose as chil- 
dren, but that does not matter. They are, at least, 
led by an idea. In their earliest years children want 
to become chauffeurs, watchmen, conductors, or 
whatever positions visible to them appear attractive 
to their childish valuations. But when a child has no 
material goal in view, it is to be suspected that he 
wants to keej) his eyes awa5:^ from the future, to re- 
turn to the past; or, in other words, to avoid the 
future and all problems connected with it. 

This seems to contradict one of the basic claims of 
Individual Psychology. We have always spoken of 
the striving for superiority characteristic of chil- 
dren, and we have attempted to show that every child 
wants to unfold himself, to become bigger than the 
others, to accomplish something. Suddenly we have 
before us a child of whom the contrary can be said; 
a child who wants to go backwards, wants to be small 
and to have others support him. How are we to ex- 
plain it? Movements in mental life are not primi- 
tive. They have a complicated background. Were we 
to draw naive conclusions in complicated cases we 
would always be mistaken. There are tricks in all 
these complications, and any dialectical attempt to 


 
make the opposite out of the thing itself j aSj for 
example, to say that the hoy struggles in a Backward 
direction because he appears, in that way, the Hg» 
gest, and in the safest position, must be confusing 
unless one understands the whole picture com- 
pletely. In point of fact, these children are right in 
an amusing way. They can never be so strong or so 
dominating as during the time when they are really 
quite small, weak and helpless, and nothing is de- 
manded of them. This child, who had no confidence 
in himself, was afraid he could not accomplish any- 
thing. Are we then to assume that he will willingly 
face a future which will expect something from 
him? He must avoid every situation in which his 
strength and abilities will be used to measure him as 
an individual. NTothing remains, therefore, but a 
greatly restricted sphere of activity where little will 
be asked of him. In this way we can understand that 
only a small portion remains of his striving for 
recognition, the recognition which he received as a 
tiny child dependent upon others. 

We had to confer not only with the boy’s teacher, 
his mother and older brother, but with bis father and 
with our colleagues. Such a string of conferences en- 
tails much work, and a great deal of labor could be 
saved if we could win the teacher over. This is not 



 
impossible^ bet it is not simple. Many teachers still 
cling fast to old methods and beliefs and regard psy- 
chological examinations as something extraordinary. 
Many of them fear that a psychological examina- 
tion indicates a loss of power or else they regard it as 
an unwarranted interference. This is, of course, not 
so. Psychology is a science which cannot he learned 
all at once, but must he studied and practiced. It is, 
however, of little use when one has the wrong point 
of view. 

Tolerance is also a necessary quality, especially 
for a teacher, and it is wise to have an open mind to 
new psychological ideas, even when they seem to 
contradict the views we have held hitherto. As con- 
ditions exist to-day, we have no right to contradict 
flatly the opinion of the teacher. What are we to do 
in such a difficult situation? In our experience noth- 
ing remains to he done in such cases but to take the 
child out of his difficult predicament — that is to say, 
to remove him from that particular school. ]N o one 
is hurt by this procedure. Practically no one knows 
what is going on, but a burden falls from the shoul- 
ders of the boy. He enters a new situation where 
nothing is known to him. He can take care not to 
let other people think badly of him, not to let him- 
self be held in contempt by others. How this is ar- 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 
ranged is not easy to explain. Family circumstances 
have a great deal to do with it. Probably every case 
requires a slightly different handling. It will, how- 
ever, be much easier to deal with such children when 
there are a goodly number of teachers versed in In- 
dividual Psychology, who will regard such cases with 
understanding eyes and be able to help the children 
in the school.
