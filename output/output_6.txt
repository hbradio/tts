CHAPTER NINE 


THE NEW SITUATION AS A TEST OF 
PREPAEATION 

N ot only is psychic life a unity, in the sense 
that all expressions of personality at any 
one time hang together, but it is also a continuity. 
The unfolding of personality in time takes place 
without sudden jumps. Present and future conduct 
is always consistent with past character. This is not 
to say that the events in an individual’s life are me- 
chanically determined by the past and by heredity, 
but it does mean that the future and past hang to- 
gether without a break. We cannot jump out of 
our skins overnight, although we never know what 
is in our skins — ^that is to say we never know our 
full capabilities, until the moment that we express 
them. 

In this fact of continuity without mechanical de- 
terminism, lies not merely the possibility of educa- 
tion and improvement, hut also the possibility of 
detecting the state of character development at 
U9 


 
any given time. When an individual passes into a 
new situation, his hidden character traits come out. 
If we could directly experiment with individualss 
we could find out their state of development by 
putting them through new and unexpected situa- 
tions. Their conduct in such situations must be con- 
sistent with their past character, and it reveals 
their character in a way that ordinary situations 
do not. 

In the case of children we get perhaps the best 
insights into their character at those moments of 
transitioHj when they pass from home to school, or 
when their home conditions are suddenly changed. 
It is then that the limitations in the child's charac- 
ter come out as clearly as an image on a photo- 
graphic plate when it is put in a developing solu- 
tion. 

We had occasion once to observe an adopted 
child. He was incorrigible, had temper tantrums, 
and one could never tell what he was going to do 
next. When we spoke with the child he did not 
answer intelligently. He talked about things that 
had no connection with our questions. After we 
had considered the whole situation we thought; 
This child has been in the home of his foster par- 
ents for some months and maintains a hostile atti- 


 
tilde toward them. Consequently he doesn't like it 
there. 

It was the only conclusion that one could draw 
from the situation. His foster parents shook their 
heads at first and said that the child was well 
treateds in fact better than he had ever been treated 
before in his life. But that is not decisive. We often 
hear parents say; “We have tried everything with 
the childs gentleness and severity, and nothing has 
helped.'’ Kindness by itself is not enough. There 
are children who react favorably to kindness, but 
we must not imagine that we have changed them. 
They believe that they are for a time in a favorable 
position, but basically they have remained the same 
and the disappearance of the kindness would at 
once bring back the old condition. 

What is necessary is an understanding of how 
this child feels and thinks — ^how he interprets his 
situation — and not what his parents think. We 
pointed out to the foster parents that this child did 
not feel happy with them. We could not tell them 
whether or not he was justified in his attitude, but 
something must have happened to arouse such hate 
in the child. We told them that if they did not 
feel capable of correcting the child’s mistakes and 
winning bis love, they would have to give him away 


 
to some one else, because be would always rebel 
against wbat be considered an imprisonment. La- 
ter we heard that the boy had become a veri- 
table fury, and he was considered actually danger- 
ous. The child might have been slightly improved 
by gentle treatment but that would not have been 
enough because he did not understand the whole 
scheme which became clear to us as we elicited 
further information. The real explanation of the 
case follows: He grew up with the children of his 
foster parents and believed that they did not care 
for him as much as they did for their own children. 
That is certainly no reason for such temper tan- 
trums, hut the child wanted to get out of the house 
and consequently every act which would further 
his desire seemed to him suitable. He acted intelli- 
gently in the light of the goal he had placed for 
himself and we can disregard any consideration of 
possible feeble-mindedness. It took the family 
some time to realize that they would have to give 
him away if they felt incapable of changing his be- 
havior. 

When one punishes such a child for his lapses, 
the punishment is for him a good reason for con- 
tinuing his rebellion. It is a confirmation of his 
feeling that he is right in rebelling. We have a 



 
sound basis for our views, and from this point it 
can be seen that all the child’s errors are to be 
understood only as the results of a fight against 
the environment, the results of his meeting a new 
situation for which he • had not been prepared. 
Childish as these mistakes are they need not sur- 
prise us, since we see the same childish manifesta” 
tions in adult life. 

The interpretation of gestures and unostenta- 
tious forms of expression is an almost unexplored 
field. Probably no one is in so good a position as 
the teacher to arrange all these forms into a 
scheme and to examine their connection with each 
other and their origin. It must be remembered that 
one form of expression may on different occasions 
have different meanings; that two children can do 
the same thing without having it mean the same. 
Furthermore the forms of expression in problem 
children are varied even when they arise from the 
same psychological cause. It is simply that there is 
more than one road to a certain goal. 

We cannot speak here of right or ’^vrong from 
the point of view of common sense. When children 
make a mistake it is because they have a mistaken 
goal. Consequently what proceeds as the result of 
a striving to this mistaken goal is also mistaken. It 


 
is a peculiarity in the nature of mankind that the 
possibilities for making mistakes are innumerable 
but that it has only one truth at its disposal. 

There are several forms of expression to which 
no attention is paid at school but which are of sig- 
nificance. For example, there is the position in 
sleep. An interesting case is that of a fifteen-year- 
old boy who suffered from the hallucination that 
the then Emperor Francis Joseph I had died and 
had appeared to him as a ghost, ordering him to 
organize an army and proceed against Russia. 
When we came to his room at night to see how he 
slept we saw a striking picture. He was lying in 
bed in the position of Napoleon. When we saw him 
the next day his posture was similar to the military 
pose expressed in his sleeping position. The con- 
nection between the hallucination and his waking 
attitude seemed rather clear. We inveigled him 
into a conversation in which we tried to convince 
him that the Emperor still lived. He did not want 
to believe it. He told us that he had always been 
teased about his small stature when he waited on 
the guests in the cafe. When we asked him if he 
knew some one who had the same posture in walk- 
ing he thought a little and then said, “My teacher, 


 


Mr. Meier.” We seemed to be on the right track 
and were able to get over the difficulty by conjur- 
ing up the figure of Meier as another little Napo- 
leon. What was still more important was this item; 
The boy told us that he would like to become a 
teacher. This teacliei% Meier, was his favorite and 
he would like to imitate him- in eveiytliing. In 
short, the whole life story of this boy was summed 
up in his posture. 

A new situation is a test of a child’s prepared- 
ness. If a child has been well prepared, he meets 
new situations with confidence. If he lacks pre- 
paredness, a new situation brings a tension which 
leads to a feeling of incapacity. The feeling of in- 
capacity distorts judgment, and the reaction is un- 
true — that is to say, it does not correspond to the 
demands of the situation — ^because it is not based 
on social feeling. In other words, a child’s failure 
in school must be attributed, not only to the in- 
efficiency of the school system, but to the primary 
deficiency in the child. 

We must examine the new situation, not because 
we believe it to be the cause of deterioration in a 
child, but because we know that it shows more 


 
clearly the primary inadequate preparedness. 
Every new situation may be regarded as a test of 
preparedness. 

In this connection we may again take up for dis- 
cussion some points in the questionnaire (see Ap- 
pendix I), 

plaint? Our attention is at once called to a new 
situation. When a mother remarks that her child 
was all right till he went to school, she tells us more 
than she really understands. The school has been 
too much for the child. It is not enough when the 
mother answers, “For the last three years.” We 
must know what changes took place three years 
ago in the child’s environment or in his own phys- 
ical condition. 

The first sign of a child’s waning faith in him- 
self is frequently found in his inability to adapt 
himself to school life. The initial failure is some- 
times not taken seriously enough and it may mean 
a catastrophe for the child. We must find out how 
often a child has been spanked for receiving bad 
school marks, and what effect these marks or the 
spankings have had on his striving for superiority. 
The child may become convinced that he is inca- 
pable of accomplishment, especially if his parents 


 


are in tlie liabit of saying, “You’ll never amount 
to anything,” or “You’ll end up on the gallows.” 

Some children are spurred on by failure; others 
break down. Children who lose confidence in them- 
selves and faith in the future must be encouraged. 
They must be treated gently, patiently and tol- 
erantly. 

A brusque explanation of sex may shock a child 
into confusion. The brilliant success of a sister or 
brother may deter him from further effort. 

the child’s lack of preparedness noticeable up to 
the time of change in his situation? We get all 
kinds of answers to this question. “The child was 
disorderly,” which means that the mother used to 
do everything for him. “He was always timid,” 
which means great attachment to the family. When 
a child is described as weakly, we may assume that 
he was born with weak organs, was spoiled or pam- 
pered because of his weakness, or he may have been 
neglected on account of ugliness. This question 
also refers to a possible feeble-mindedness. The 
child may have developed very slowly so that he 
was suspected of being mentally weak. Even 
though he later grew out of this condition, he would 
still retain the feeling of having been pampered or 



 
restricted, and these feelings vt^oiild make much 
more difficult any attempt to cope with a new sit- 
uation. If we are told that the child is cov^ardiy 
and careless, we may be sure that he thereby se- 
cures the attention of another. 

The first task of a teacher is to win the child, and 
thereafter to nourish his courage. When a child is 
clumsy the teacher must find out whether he is left- 
handed. If the child is clumsy to an exaggerated 
degree the teacher should find out whether the 
child fully understands his sexual role. Boys who 
grow up in a feminine environment, who avoid the 
company of other boys, who are teased and mocked 
and often treated like girls — such boys accustom 
themselves to the part of girls, and later develop 
rather stormy internal conflicts. Ignorance of the 
organic sexual distinction between male and fe« 
male leads children to believe that it is possible to 
change their sex. But they eventually discover that 
their bodily constitution is unchangeable and try to 
compensate by developing either mental masculine 
or feminine traits, according to the sex to which 
they wish to belong. They express these tendencies 
in dress and deportment. 

Some girls develop a loathing for feminine oc- 
cupations. The chief reason is the supposed value- 


 
lessness of siicli work, which expresses indeed a 
basic failure of our civilization. The tradition still 
exists that men have privileges which are denied to 
women. Our civilization is distinctly to man's ad“ 
vantage and approves of certain rights which men 
assume for themselves. The birth of a son usually 
arouses more joy than the arrival of a daughter. 
This cannot but be a harmful influence on both son 
and daughter. The thorn of inferiority stings the 
girl very soon, while the boy is burdened with ex- 
pectations. Girls are restricted in their develop- 
ment, There are countries in which this compulsion 
is no longer so noticeable; for example, in America. 
But in social relations no balance has yet been 
achieved, even in this country. 

We are concerned here with the whole mentality 
of manliind which is mirrored in the children. The 
acceptance of the role of woman involves some 
hardship which occasionally incites revolt. This re- 
volt expresses itself frequently in imruliness, stub- 
bornness, indolence, all of which have to do with a 
striving for superiority. When such symptoms ap- 
pear, the teacher must find out whether the girl is 
dissatisfied with her sex. 

This particular dissatisfaction may grow to in- 
clude ail other fields, so that life in general becomes 


 
a burden. Occasionally we meet with the expression 
of the desire to live on another planet where man- 
kind is not bhsexual. Such erroneous thought proc- 
esses can lead to various absurdities, or to complete 
apathy, criminality and even suicide. Punishment 
and lack of affection only strengthen the feeling of 
inadequacy. 

Such unfortunate conditions can be avoided 
when the child learns in an unobtrusive fashion the 
difference between man and woman and is taught 
that each is worth as much as the other. It usually 
happens that the father seems to have a sort of 
superiority. The father appears to be the possessor, 
makes the rules, directs, explains to his wife and. 
decides. Brothers try to be superior to their sisters, 
and make them dissatisfied with their sex by scorn 
and criticism. The psychologist understands that 
such conduct on the part of brothers springs from 
their own feeling of weakness. It is quite different 
to be able to do something than only to seem to be 
able. The argument that ’^fomen have up to now 
not been able to point to great accomplishments is 
quite worthless. Women have not heretofore been 
reared to do great things. Men have put in the 
hands of women stockings to mend, and have tried 
to convince women that that was their work. This 


 
lias been partly done away with, but the way we 
prepare girls to-day does not indicate that we ex- 
pect anything extraordinary of them. 

To hinder preparation and then adversely crit- 
icize inferior accomplishment is short-sighted. It 
is not easy to improve the present situation because 
it happens that not only fathers but mothers as well 
look upon masculine privileges as justified and 
rear their children according to this idea. They 
teach their children that masculine authority is 
right and their boys demand obedience and the girls 
resign themselves to it. Children should know at as 
early an age as possible to which sex they belong, 
and also that their sex is unchangeable. Women, 
as we have said, have developed resentment against 
the masculine assumption of authority and superi- 
ority. Where this resentment is so great that it is 
expressed in a woman’s refusing to accept her sex 
and striving to be as much like a man as possible. 
Individual Psychology has called it the “masculine 
protest.” Secondary symptoms, such as deformity 
or incomplete development, often lead adults to 
doubt their sex in reference to anatomical comple- 
tion (masculine physical characteristics in girls and 
feminine in boys). These beliefs are sometimes 
deeply imbedded and related to constitutional 


 
weaknesses. A childish bodily construction, more 
noticeable in the case of a man than a woman., gives 
rise to the remark that the man has feminine char- 
acteristics. This is untrue, for such a man resembles 
much more a child. A man whose body does not de- 
velop completely feels himself painfully inferior 
because the general ideal of our civilization is that 
of man fuil-growm, whose achievements must sur- 
pass those of woman. An incomplete development 
or lack of beauty in the case of a girl also leads fre- 
quently to an aversion to the problems of life be- 
cause we overvalue beauty. 

Disposition, temperament and feelings are ter- 
tiary sexual indications. Sensitive boys are called 
feminine; poised, self-confident girls are described 
as masculine. Such traits are never innate, they 
are always acquired. These characteristics in early 
childhood are remembered later and adults refer 
to the fact that they were peculiar as children, that 
they were reserved or behaved like boys or girls, as 
the case may be. They developed according to the 
interpretation of their respective sexual roles. The 
further question, how far sexual development and 
experience has gone, means that a certain under- 
standing is expected at a certain age. I should say 
that at least ninety per cent of the children, when 


 
parents or educators finally explain sexual m.at“ 
ters to thenij liave already learned the facts long 
before^ Mo hard and fast rules concerning sexual 
explanation can be made, because one cannot pre- 
dict what a child will accept, or will credit in such 
an explanation, or in general what effect it will 
have on hini. As soon as the child asks for an ex- 
planation, it should be given after considering care- 
fully the condition of the child at the time. Pre- 
mature explanation is inadvisable, even though it 
does not always have a harmful effect. 

The question of an adopted child or a step-child 
is a difficult one. Children belonging to either of 
these classes take good treatment as a matter of 
coui’se and blame all severity on their special fam- 
ily position. Sometimes a child who has lost his 
mother attaches himself closely to his father. After 
a while the father marries and the child feels that 
he has been shut out and refuses to make friends 
with the stepmother. It is interesting to note that 
a few children regard, their real parents as step- 
parents, which implies, of course, harsh criticism 
and complaint. Step-parents have acquired a bad 
reputation on account of the many fairy tales in 
which they are the evil characters. Fairy tales, it 
may be said in passing, are not perfect reading’ ma- 


THE EDUCATION OF CHILDEEN 
teria! for children. It is impossible to forbid them 
completely, because chiMren learn a great deal 
about human nature from them. But it would be 
worth while to have corrective coiiniients written 
to accompany certain stories and to prevent chil- 
dren from reading those tales which have in them 
cruelty or distorted fantasy. Fairy tales of strong 
men performing cruel deeds have been used occa- 
sionally to harden the child readers, to dwarf soft 
feelings — another mistaken idea springing from 
our hero worship. Boys think it unmanly to show 
sympathy. It is incomprehensible why tender emo- 
tion is scorned, since it is indubitably valuable when 
it is not misused — although any emotion can of 
course be misused. 

Illegitimate children, too, are in an extremely 
difficult situation. It goes without saying that it is 
not right that the woman and the child should bear 
the burden of illegitimacy while the man goes scot 
free. The one who pays the greatest price is, of 
course, the child. NTo matter, how one wants to help 
such children it is impossible to prevent their suf- 
fering, for their common sense soon tells them that 
all is not in order. They are scorned by their com- 
panions or else the laws of the country make living 
conditions hard, and illegitimacy is legally branded 


 
on them. Because of their sensitiveness they quarrel 
easily and develop a hostile attitude to the worlds 
for in every language there are ugly, insulting and 
painfully degrading words for such children. It is 
easily understandable why there are so many or- 
phans and illegitimate children among problem 
children and criminals. It is impossible to attribute 
these asocial tendencies in illegitimate or orphaned 
children to innate or inherited dispositions.
